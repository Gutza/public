# Donald Trump's Crypto Cover: Venezuela, Epstein, and the Billion-Dollar Coin Game

In the pre-dawn hours of a January Saturday, Americans awoke to shocking news: U.S. forces had launched **overnight strikes on Venezuela’s capital** and **claimed the capture of President Nicolás Maduro** ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/03/maduro-captured-during-overnight-u-s-strikes-on-venezuelas-capital/)). Explosions rocked Caracas as **multiple targets** – from military installations to infrastructure – came under fire ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/03/maduro-captured-during-overnight-u-s-strikes-on-venezuelas-capital/)). President Donald Trump triumphantly announced that **Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were in U.S. custody** to face drug-trafficking charges ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/03/maduro-captured-during-overnight-u-s-strikes-on-venezuelas-capital/)). Caracas, however, denounced the operation as an **“unjustified aggression”** and demanded proof of life for the detained leader ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/03/maduro-captured-during-overnight-u-s-strikes-on-venezuelas-capital/)). The **unprecedented raid** – the most significant U.S. military action in Venezuela in decades – stunned the world, raising alarms across Latin America about **violations of sovereignty and international law** ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/03/maduro-captured-during-overnight-u-s-strikes-on-venezuelas-capital/)).

Critics at home were equally aghast. The *New York Times* editorial board blasted Trump’s Venezuela strike as **“illegal and unwise,”** noting he had **“not yet offered a coherent explanation”** and bypassed Congress, thereby **violating U.S. law** ([Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/ny-times-editorial-board-scorches-trumps-illegal-and-unwise-attack-on-venezuela-mr-trumps-warmongering-violates-the-law/)). The administration’s **nominal rationale** – that the raid was merely a “law-enforcement” action against *narco-terrorists* – struck the *Times* as **“particularly ludicrous”** ([Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/ny-times-editorial-board-scorches-trumps-illegal-and-unwise-attack-on-venezuela-mr-trumps-warmongering-violates-the-law/)). In an unusually scathing rebuke, the editors warned that **Mr. Trump’s warmongering violates the law** and risks igniting a broader crisis with **“no valid reasons”** offered for such adventurism ([Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/ny-times-editorial-board-scorches-trumps-illegal-and-unwise-attack-on-venezuela-mr-trumps-warmongering-violates-the-law/)). The stage seemed set for a major international confrontation. Yet to some seasoned observers, something about this **dramatic Venezuela gambit** didn’t add up – unless one looked at what else was unfolding behind the scenes.

## The Venezuela Shocker and Saber Rattling

For Trump, the **Venezuela operation** was not a standalone event but part of a escalating pattern. Weeks prior, his administration had been **massing military hardware in the Caribbean**. The Pentagon even **deployed a nuclear-powered submarine, surveillance aircraft, and 15,000 troops** near Venezuela in a show of force ([DL News](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/how-trump-sabre-rattling-is-driving-venezuelans-to-embrace-crypto-like-never-before/)). U.S. forces **seized a Venezuelan oil tanker** off the coast – allegedly to choke off Caracas’ support to Cuba – and signaled more ship seizures to come ([DL News](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/how-trump-sabre-rattling-is-driving-venezuelans-to-embrace-crypto-like-never-before/)). Trump’s newly appointed *Secretary of War*, Pete Hegseth, had **authorized lethal strikes on purported drug-running boats**, actions that **killed dozens of people** ([DL News](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/how-trump-sabre-rattling-is-driving-venezuelans-to-embrace-crypto-like-never-before/)). These deadly boat attacks provoked **bipartisan outrage** in Washington, with members of both parties condemning them as possible **war crimes** ([DL News](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/how-trump-sabre-rattling-is-driving-venezuelans-to-embrace-crypto-like-never-before/)). Still, Trump **justified the campaign** as a crusade to **combat fentanyl trafficking** – casting Venezuela’s government as a cartel regime pumping drugs into American streets ([DL News](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/how-trump-sabre-rattling-is-driving-venezuelans-to-embrace-crypto-like-never-before/)).

When the **overnight raid captured Maduro**, Trump doubled down on bellicose rhetoric. In the days that followed, he **openly threatened other Latin American leaders** – a remarkable bout of saber-rattling in the Western Hemisphere ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/04/all-about-epstein-carville-says-trump-invaded-venezuela-for-a-simple-reason/)). He singled out **Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum**, accusing her of failing to control drug cartels, and **denounced Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro** for “*making cocaine*” ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/04/all-about-epstein-carville-says-trump-invaded-venezuela-for-a-simple-reason/)). To Petro, Trump issued an ominous warning on live television: the Colombian leader should **“watch his ass”**, as the U.S. had him in its sights ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/04/all-about-epstein-carville-says-trump-invaded-venezuela-for-a-simple-reason/)). Cuba’s government, a longstanding Maduro ally, was similarly put on notice. The message was clear – Trump was flexing U.S. military might across the Americas, implying that **no adversary in the region was safe from unilateral American intervention**.

This tough-guy posture played well to Trump’s base, projecting strength and defiance. But it also invited scrutiny. After all, just **weeks earlier Trump had quietly pardoned** a convicted Latin American drug kingpin – former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández, who was serving a 45-year sentence in the U.S. for trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine ([WIFR](https://www.wifr.com/2026/01/04/after-capture-removal-venezuelas-maduro-is-being-held-notorious-brooklyn-jail/)). Freeing an admitted narco-trafficker in December, then invoking a war on drugs to justify invading Venezuela in January, struck many as **cynically contradictory**. Was the **“narco-terror”** narrative merely convenient cover? And if so, cover for *what*? The answer, some observers insist, lies in an entirely different scandal reaching a boiling point in parallel with the Venezuela drama.

## Epstein Files and a Curious Coincidence

Even as U.S. special forces breached Caracas, a slow-moving bombshell was ticking away in Washington: the **Epstein Files**. Late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s trove of documents – FBI reports, flight logs, and subpoenaed records – had begun to trickle out, threatening to expose powerful figures tied to his sex-trafficking empire. By law, the Department of Justice faced a **January 4, 2026 deadline** to explain why it had heavily **redacted and withheld thousands of Epstein-related files** in defiance of Congress. That deadline came and went **the very day of Trump’s Venezuelan adventure**. House Democrats on the Oversight Committee could not help noticing the timing. In a pointed social media post, they noted that the DOJ’s Epstein transparency deadline **“coincided with President Donald Trump invading a sovereign nation and kidnapping its leader, as Americans slept.”** The lawmakers drily added, **“We are sure it’s just a coincidence”**, vowing not to forget despite the President’s new “unconstitutional actions” ([Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/coincidence-democrats-say-epstein-file-deadline-slipped-as-trump-launched-foreign-operation/articleshow/126337489.cms)). The implication was unmistakable: **Trump’s bold foreign attack had conveniently diverted attention** from the Epstein accountability moment.

To veteran Democratic strategist **James Carville**, there was nothing coincidental about it. He flatly declared that pundits searching for Trump’s policy motive in Venezuela were missing the obvious. **“Why’s he doing this? ... It’s Jeffrey Epstein,”** Carville exclaimed, calling the entire operation **“a diversion from the ongoing release of the Epstein Files.”** ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/04/all-about-epstein-carville-says-trump-invaded-venezuela-for-a-simple-reason/)). As millions of documents from Epstein’s cases continued to surface, Carville urged Americans to **“wake up!”** and **“get the scales off your eyes”** about Trump’s true aim ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/04/all-about-epstein-carville-says-trump-invaded-venezuela-for-a-simple-reason/)). *“If you think this is anything remotely legit...come on, please! It’s all about Epstein!”* he said, arguing that **no genuine U.S. interest was at stake in Venezuela** aside from distracting the public ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/04/all-about-epstein-carville-says-trump-invaded-venezuela-for-a-simple-reason/)). In Carville’s vivid phrase, Trump was acting in **“reptilian survival”** mode – doing whatever it took to **draw attention away from Epstein** and the damning revelations emerging daily ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/04/all-about-epstein-carville-says-trump-invaded-venezuela-for-a-simple-reason/)).

Indeed, the **Epstein saga** was reaching uncomfortable proximity to Trump’s world. Among the files that the DOJ did release (and then mysteriously **deleted from its website**) was **a photograph of Trump with Epstein himself** ([Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/coincidence-democrats-say-epstein-file-deadline-slipped-as-trump-launched-foreign-operation/articleshow/126337489.cms)). And while the administration claimed redactions were to protect victims’ privacy, critics noted that **millions of pages were still being withheld** without clear justification ([Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/coincidence-democrats-say-epstein-file-deadline-slipped-as-trump-launched-foreign-operation/articleshow/126337489.cms)). A rare left-right coalition in Congress – spearheaded by Democrat Ro Khanna and pro-Trump Republican Thomas Massie – had grown so frustrated that they sought a court-appointed *special master* to seize control of the Epstein files and ensure full disclosure ([Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/coincidence-democrats-say-epstein-file-deadline-slipped-as-trump-launched-foreign-operation/articleshow/126337489.cms)). **Attorney General Pam Bondi**, a Trump loyalist now in charge of DOJ, faced threats of contempt for dragging her feet ([Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/coincidence-democrats-say-epstein-file-deadline-slipped-as-trump-launched-foreign-operation/articleshow/126337489.cms)). The material under wraps was widely rumored to include **“the documents that name the rich and powerful men”** who frequented Epstein’s private island or helped cover up his crimes ([Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/coincidence-democrats-say-epstein-file-deadline-slipped-as-trump-launched-foreign-operation/articleshow/126337489.cms)). In short, the Epstein scandal had the potential to **implicate a Who’s Who of elites – possibly even Trump or his associates – in heinous abuse.**

Little wonder, then, that Trump’s sudden militaristic zeal struck many as **political misdirection**. As Colombian President Gustavo Petro (one of Trump’s targets) darkly observed, **“the United States is run by a ‘clan of pedophiles’”** desperate to keep Epstein’s list of clientele from coming out ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/04/all-about-epstein-carville-says-trump-invaded-venezuela-for-a-simple-reason/)). **“To keep the list from coming out, they send warships to kill fishermen,”** Petro scoffed, referring to U.S. naval maneuvers near his region ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/04/all-about-epstein-carville-says-trump-invaded-venezuela-for-a-simple-reason/)). The comment was hyperbolic, but it underscored a growing perception abroad: **Trump’s Venezuela escapade was a spectacle serving his own interests**, not a principled intervention. And chief among those interests – beyond avoiding Epstein fallout – was an entirely different enterprise that had come to define his second presidency: **cryptocurrency.**

## A Crypto Empire Built on the Presidency

Behind Trump’s foreign bravado lies what critics call a **“glorified con”** of a different sort: the massive **Trump family crypto ventures** that have boomed since his return to power. In 2025, as Trump settled back into the Oval Office, his adult sons launched an ambitious new cryptocurrency company, **World Liberty Financial (WLFI)**, in partnership with family friend and real estate developer Steve Witkoff. The venture’s premise was flashy but vague – selling Trump-branded crypto tokens and even meme coins (\$TRUMP and \$MELANIA) to the public – all while Trump himself heavily **deregulated the crypto industry** from the White House ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-year-in-trump-cashing-in)). The scale of the First Family’s enrichment from this scheme has been **staggering**. A Reuters investigation found that in the **first half of 2025 alone**, the Trump family **raked in over \$800 million from sales of crypto assets**, on top of **potentially billions more in paper gains** from coins they held ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigations/inside-trump-familys-global-crypto-cash-machine-2025-10-28/)). Such sums dwarf any past presidential business entanglements. Ethics experts note that the alignment of Trump’s private crypto interests with his public policy role is a **“conflict of interest unprecedented in modern presidential history.”** ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigations/inside-trump-familys-global-crypto-cash-machine-2025-10-28/))

The mechanics of Trump’s **crypto cash machine** have been laid bare in media reports. According to Reuters and other outlets, **foreign investors** have eagerly poured money into Trump-linked crypto tokens, apparently **to curry favor with the president**. More than *two-thirds* of the purchases of World Liberty’s tokens in early sales were traced to digital wallets likely based **overseas** ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-year-in-trump-cashing-in)). One early buyer was **Justin Sun**, a Chinese crypto mogul facing SEC fraud charges – who plunked down \$30 million for WLFI tokens and loudly touted his support for Trump’s crypto vision ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-year-in-trump-cashing-in)). (Soon after Trump took office, the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Sun ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-year-in-trump-cashing-in)).) In another case, Trump’s sons courted a **shadowy UAE entity** that bought \$100 million worth of tokens after private meetings in Dubai ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigations/inside-trump-familys-global-crypto-cash-machine-2025-10-28/)). Five separate foreign crypto entrepreneurs told Reuters they sought out Eric and Don Jr. specifically *because* of their father’s power, **“hopes of cashing in on his political and financial power.”** ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigations/inside-trump-familys-global-crypto-cash-machine-2025-10-28/)) The message was implicit but clear: investing in **Trump-branded crypto** might gain you goodwill – or at least access – with the most powerful man in the world.

Meanwhile, Trump’s official actions have consistently **tilted the playing field to boost crypto profits**. He appointed a **“crypto czar”** in the White House and ordered agencies to purge regulations unfavorable to digital assets ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-year-in-trump-cashing-in)). His regulators have shelved or reversed enforcement cases against major crypto players ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-year-in-trump-cashing-in)). In a flashy publicity move, Trump even announced plans for a U.S. **“Strategic Bitcoin Reserve”** and encouraged federal purchase of Bitcoin ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-year-in-trump-cashing-in)). All these moves drove up crypto market enthusiasm – and, not coincidentally, the value of the Trump family’s own holdings. By late 2025, observers estimated the Trumps’ personal crypto portfolio was worth as much as **\$5–11 billion** on paper ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-year-in-trump-cashing-in)) ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigations/inside-trump-familys-global-crypto-cash-machine-2025-10-28/)). Congressional Democrats sounded alarms in a staff report, accusing Trump of **“leveraging his office to make himself a crypto billionaire”** by extending **“broad protection”** to the industry while hyping America as the “crypto capital of the world” ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-year-in-trump-cashing-in)).

The **ethical lines** in this arrangement are, at best, blurry. Trump never divested from his businesses, meaning he stood to gain financially from policies he enacted. World Liberty Financial’s structure guaranteed the Trumps an astonishing **\$0.70 of every \$1** invested in their tokens as pure revenue ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-year-in-trump-cashing-in)). Unlike traditional investments, these tokens offered buyers little concrete value beyond association with the Trump brand. “It’s basically about **being part of the club**,” one skeptical crypto analyst observed ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigations/inside-trump-familys-global-crypto-cash-machine-2025-10-28/)). And yet, people around the globe have paid to join that club – arguably **buying influence under the guise of buying coins**. From Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds to wealthy political allies, money has flowed into Trump’s ventures. In one striking example, **Middle East developers announced new Trump real estate projects** (a Dubai hotel and a Qatar golf resort) in tandem with Trump family crypto deals, intertwining foreign policy, business, and personal profit ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-year-in-trump-cashing-in)).

## Showmanship Over Statecraft

Viewed in isolation, Trump’s **Venezuela saber-rattling** and the **Epstein files saga** might seem unrelated to his **crypto windfall**. But put together, they form a jigsaw puzzle of a presidency driven less by ideology or national strategy than by **personal stakes**. Trump’s former national security decisions often baffled experts seeking a doctrinal thread. Now, a coherent thread emerges: **self-preservation and self-enrichment**: if one assumes Trump has **zero ideology or sense of policy** beyond his own interests, the pattern snaps into focus.

By many accounts, **Donald Trump is a showman first and foremost** – a leader prone to headline-grabbing gestures that enthrall his base and dominate news cycles, often at the expense of long-term strategy. The Venezuela intervention bears hallmarks of such showmanship. It was **bold and unprecedented**, sure to rally nationalist fervor and distract from awkward stories (like Epstein) that had been dogging the White House. It also positioned Trump as a wartime leader, a role historically known to boost incumbents’ standing. But on closer scrutiny, **this show lacked substance**: the official rationale was paper-thin, the legality in question, and the benefits to U.S. interests dubious at best ([Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/ny-times-editorial-board-scorches-trumps-illegal-and-unwise-attack-on-venezuela-mr-trumps-warmongering-violates-the-law/)). What it undeniably achieved was sucking up media oxygen and giving Trump a new platform to play the strongman – just as ugly truths about Epstein’s network threatened to surface. *“Think beyond just the front of your nose!”* Carville pleaded, arguing that Trump was banking on the public’s short attention span ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2026/01/04/all-about-epstein-carville-says-trump-invaded-venezuela-for-a-simple-reason/)).

Meanwhile, **Trump’s erratic behavior on the world stage may also serve a financial logic**. A mercurial, confrontational America under Trump creates uncertainty and risk – conditions under which savvy actors might be willing to **pay a premium for stability or access**. For U.S. adversaries and allies alike, smoothing things over with Trump’s Washington could mean **making deals on the side**. Sometimes that currency is literal currency: crypto investments, business patronage, lavish deals benefiting Trump personally. It is telling that as Trump ramped up pressure on Venezuela, **Venezuelan civilians flocked to cryptocurrency as a lifeline** – pushing the country to **11th place globally in crypto adoption** amid the turmoil ([DL News](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/how-trump-sabre-rattling-is-driving-venezuelans-to-embrace-crypto-like-never-before/)). In effect, Trump’s bellicosity was *driving* demand for the very crypto ecosystem that enriches his family. And abroad, actors with deep pockets – from Beijing to Abu Dhabi – clearly concluded that **one way to calm an erratic White House was to enrich it**. Buying into Trump’s family tokens or ventures wasn’t just an investment; it was **a backdoor into Trump’s good graces**, a transactional insurance policy in an uncertain geopolitical climate.

All of this supports a portrait of a president who **“has probably conned even his own supporters”**. Trump rose to power on a *America First* nationalist platform, yet his second-term actions often seem aimed at **protecting his cronies and assets first**. The **Maduro operation** did little for American democracy or security – but it handed Trump a perfect distraction and possibly leverage in other dealings. The **Epstein files release** threatens scores of powerful people, possibly including Trump’s acquaintances; his response was not transparency but a dramatic pivot to another storyline. And the **crypto empire** flourishing in his shadow shows where his focus truly lies: not in draining the swamp, but **diverting it into his own channels**.

## Conclusion

In weaving together the Venezuela strike, the Epstein scandal, and Trump’s crypto exploits, a consistent narrative emerges of a presidency driven by **showmanship over statecraft**. Trump’s actions – from military adventures to regulatory U-turns – make sense when one follows the trail of **personal benefit and survival**. **A sitting U.S. president orchestrated an international incident** at the precise moment his Justice Department was poised to face scrutiny over Epstein’s secrets ([Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/coincidence-democrats-say-epstein-file-deadline-slipped-as-trump-launched-foreign-operation/articleshow/126337489.cms)). The incident distracted the nation and, for a time, buried the lead. At the same time, that president was and is **openly profiting from foreign money** via a deregulated crypto free-for-all he enabled ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/investigations/inside-trump-familys-global-crypto-cash-machine-2025-10-28/)) ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-year-in-trump-cashing-in)). It is a picture of governance as theater – dramatic external clashes to mask internal dealings.

Whether this grand gambit will ultimately **“work”** for Trump remains to be seen. The **Epstein files** are still likely to dribble out, thanks to bipartisan pressure, potentially exposing uncomfortable truths despite the delay. The **Venezuela adventure** has drawn comparisons to past U.S. missteps and could yet entangle America in long-term instability or conflict ([Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/ny-times-editorial-board-scorches-trumps-illegal-and-unwise-attack-on-venezuela-mr-trumps-warmongering-violates-the-law/)). And the **crypto markets** that lifted the Trumps’ fortune have been volatile – recent months saw Trump-themed coins plummet in value by double digits ([The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/the-year-in-trump-cashing-in)), proving that even con men cannot repeal the laws of economics. Yet, for now, Donald Trump continues to barrel forward, **fusing spectacle with self-interest** in a way no modern American leader has. The jigsaw puzzle of his motives may never be acknowledged by the man himself – but as investigators, journalists, and even foreign presidents have indicated, **the pieces are all there on the table** for those willing to see them.
