# The Witkoff Leak

I couldn't find a good overview of what we know about the Witkoff leak, so I decided to write my own. What you'll find below:
- Context
- What the leaked calls show
- Who leaked the calls?
- Reactions
- Relevance, moving forward

## Context: the Trump 28-point peace plan and Witkoff’s role

* Trump’s administration has been pushing a **28-point plan** to end the war in Ukraine, explicitly modelled on his Gaza ceasefire deal. The plan is being drafted by the U.S. with **heavy Russian input**, particularly via Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and a key Kremlin fixer. ([Axios][1])
* Axios and Al Jazeera reporting, plus various leaks, converge on the same core features of the *original* draft:

  * Ukraine would **recognise Russia’s control** over **Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk**, including some currently Ukrainian-held areas of Donetsk.
  * Front lines in **Kherson** and **Zaporizhzhia** would be frozen along the current line of contact.
  * Ukraine’s armed forces would be **cut from ~900,000 to ~600,000 troops**.
  * Ukraine would be **barred from NATO**, with the EU and others offering some alternative security guarantees. ([Al Jazeera][2])
* Unsurprisingly, **Kyiv and most European capitals** saw this draft as a capitulation: “written in Russian to begin with,” as one U.S. senator described it after being briefed. ([Al Jazeera][2])
* Steve Witkoff is a New York real-estate developer, long-time Trump friend and fundraiser, made **“Special Envoy for Peace Missions”** despite having no classical diplomatic background. He helped broker Trump’s Gaza deal and has become de facto lead envoy on the Ukraine track, including multi-day drafting sessions with Dmitriev in Florida. ([Axios][1])

That’s the backdrop: an already-controversial, heavily Russia-leaning draft, being sold by a non-traditional envoy with strong personal ties to Trump and documented access to senior Russians.

## What the leaked calls show

### The Oct 14 Witkoff–Ushakov call

Bloomberg obtained and transcribed a call on **14 October 2025** between:

* **Steve Witkoff**, Trump’s special envoy
* **Yuri Ushakov**, Putin’s top foreign-policy aide and long-time Kremlin operator

Key elements from the transcript, as summarised by AP, Meduza and Euronews: ([AP News][3])

1. **Staging the Trump–Putin optics**

   * Witkoff explicitly tells Ushakov Putin should call Trump *after* the Gaza deal:

     * Congratulate him for the ceasefire,
     * Say Russia supported it,
     * Frame Trump as a “man of peace”.

   * The idea is to create a **positive, ego-stroking context** before pivoting to Ukraine:

     > “From that, it’s going to be a really good call,” Witkoff says (per AP’s summary). ([AP News][3])

   * Witkoff pushes to have the **Putin–Trump call before Zelensky’s visit to the White House**, so Trump meets Zelensky with a fresh, flattering Putin conversation in his head. ([euronews][4])

2. **Substance: what Russia “needs” to get a deal**

   * Witkoff refers to a **“20-point Trump plan”** and suggests doing the same with Moscow. ([euronews][4])

   * Crucially, he tells Ushakov:

     > “I know what it’s going to take to get a peace deal done: **Donetsk and maybe a land swap somewhere**.” ([euronews][4])

     That is: de facto acceptance that Russia must keep Donetsk and potentially receive further compensating territory.

   * He then advises not to talk openly in these terms but to “talk more hopefully,” because he believes Trump will give him broad discretion to get to a deal. ([euronews][4])

3. **Role-playing the sales job**

   * Witkoff coaches Ushakov on how to **frame the plan as shared**:

     * Suggesting Putin say that “Steve and Yuri” discussed a similar plan,
     * Presenting it as a mutual Trump–Putin peace project, rather than a Russian diktat.

4. **Frequency and informality**

   * Ushakov later confirms on Russian TV that he speaks to Witkoff “quite often” by phone, and does **not dispute the authenticity** of the transcript, while insisting that the conversations are confidential. ([AP News][3])

### The Oct 29 Ushakov–Dmitriev call

Bloomberg also obtained a **second call**, on **29 October**, between: ([AP News][3])

* **Yuri Ushakov**
* **Kirill Dmitriev**, Russian sovereign wealth fund head and key architect of the plan

Key points:

* Ushakov pushes a **maximalist Russian draft**:

  > “We need the maximum … Otherwise, what’s the point of passing anything on?” ([euronews][4])
* Dmitriev agrees to submit **“our position”** to Witkoff, acknowledging the Americans probably won’t take it “exactly,” but hoping the final plan will be “as close to it as possible.” ([AP News][3])
* This directly undercuts later U.S. claims that the 28-point plan was simply “authored by the U.S.”: Russia is plainly drafting a wish-list document intended to be the baseline. ([AP News][3])

### Verification status

* Bloomberg says it **reviewed recordings** of both calls.
* AP, Reuters and others treat the transcripts as credible but note they **have not independently verified the audio**. ([AP News][3])
* Ushakov and Kremlin spokespeople **do not deny the calls happened**, but complain about the leak instead. ([AP News][3])

So in terms of evidence: nobody serious is pretending the calls are fabricated; the argument is whether what Witkoff did is scandalous or just “hard-nosed diplomacy”.

## Who leaked the calls?

We genuinely don’t know. Newsweek lays out three plausible categories of suspects rather than a single smoking gun: ([Newsweek][5])

1. **U.S. intelligence / Western intel**

   * Parallels are drawn with the Michael Flynn case: monitoring foreign officials, then catching U.S. interlocutors on the line and leaking.
   * Richard Grenell and Glenn Greenwald suggest this is another **intelligence community hit job** against Trump-world, but provide no evidence. ([Newsweek][5])

2. **A NATO ally**

   * Some analysts speculate a European service may have intercepted and leaked the calls to **blow up a plan they see as dangerous for European security** (because of territorial concessions and restrictions on Ukraine’s military). ([Newsweek][5])

3. **Russia**

   * Moscow *denies* leaking, calling the publication an example of “hybrid warfare” and insisting the aim is to hinder U.S.–Russia rapprochement. ([Reuters][6])
   * However, Christo Grozev and other investigators point out that at least one call was held over **unencrypted GSM**, calling the Russian side “idiots” for doing high-level business on lines Western services have been exploiting for a decade. ([Newsweek][5])

Bottom line: the leak likely comes from **whichever side’s SIGINT guys were listening in** – U.S., European, or Russian – but the political narrative about the leaker is already part of the fight.

## Reactions by key actors

### Trump and the White House

Trump’s line is very simple:

* The call is **“a standard thing”**:

  * “He’s got to sell this to Ukraine. He’s got to sell Ukraine to Russia. That’s what a dealmaker does.” ([Newsweek][7])
* He insists Witkoff is talking the same way to Kyiv, and that **this is how serious negotiations work**: you speak frankly about what the other side needs, then nudge them toward it.
* Trump **does not dispute the transcript** and continues to back Witkoff, even **sending him to Moscow next week** to meet Putin, while Army Secretary Dan Driscoll goes to Kyiv. ([Newsweek][7])
* White House communications director Steven Cheung spins the leak as proof that Witkoff is **talking “nearly every day” to both Russia and Ukraine “to achieve peace”**, i.e. that the leak is evidence of industrious diplomacy rather than disloyalty. ([Newsweek][5])

Strategically, Trump has **softened his deadline** after the backlash (no more hard “Thanksgiving or else” ultimatum) and now stresses that the plan was “fine-tuned” and is not a final take-it-or-leave-it offer. ([Al Jazeera][2])

### MAGA / pro-Trump orbit

Two main themes:

1. **The leak is the scandal, not the content.**

   * Richard Grenell: “Find the leaker and fire them immediately. No excuses. The anonymous leaker is a national security risk.” ([Newsweek][5])
   * Glenn Greenwald compares it directly to the Flynn interception, calling it “the most serious leaking crime in the US Code” if U.S. intel is behind it. ([Newsweek][5])

2. **Criticism from Europe and Congress is framed as obstructionism.**

   * JD Vance, now VP, has publicly **rebuked European leaders** for their pushback, arguing that they are undermining an effort to stop the killing while still relying on U.S. security guarantees. ([Al Jazeera][2])

This camp implicitly accepts that Witkoff is being *helpful* to Moscow in form, but argues that’s **in service of a peace deal**, and that the real enemy is the leaker and the “warmongers” who want to kill the plan.

### U.S. Congress and party politics

Here the split is *not* simply Democrat vs Republican; it’s **pro-Ukraine vs “deal at any cost”**, cutting across party lines.

#### Democrats

* Rep. **Ted Lieu** (D-CA) calls Witkoff an **“actual traitor”**, adding: “Steve Witkoff is supposed to work for the United States, not Russia.” ([The Guardian][8])
* Rep. **Gregory Meeks** (D-NY) says Witkoff and Trump “are in bed with the Russians” and that the plan aligns with Russian interests. ([Newsweek][7])
* Multiple Democrats call for Witkoff’s **removal from his post** and for investigations into how this channel was set up and supervised. ([The Guardian][8])

#### Non-MAGA Republicans

* Rep. **Don Bacon** (R-NE) says the transcript shows Witkoff **“fully favors the Russians”** and asks bluntly:

  > “Would a Russian paid agent do less than he?” – concluding Witkoff “cannot be trusted” and “should be fired.” ([AP News][3])
* Other Republicans like **Brian Fitzpatrick**, **Mitch McConnell**, **Roger Wicker** criticise the plan and the back-channeling as undermining Ukraine and sidelining the State Department. ([The Guardian][9])

So you end up with an odd alignment: **hawks in both parties** are livid, while core MAGA plus some isolationist voices are defensive or focused on the leak.

### Official U.S. government line (State, etc.)

The institutional line is much more cautious:

* Secretary of State **Marco Rubio** insists the plan was **“authored by the U.S.”** with input from both Russia and Ukraine, and denies that it’s simply a Russian wish-list. ([AP News][3])
* The State Department declines detailed comment on the leaked calls, and the AP notes it has **not independently verified** Bloomberg’s audio. ([AP News][3])
* The White House **defends Witkoff** and keeps him in place, signalling Trump has no intention of sacrificing him to calm Congress. ([AP News][3])

Institutionally, they’re trying to **ring-fence the damage**: acknowledge the call exists, frame it as normal diplomacy, insist the plan is still “under negotiation”.

### Kyiv

Kyiv’s official reaction is careful and heavily filtered through the larger fight over the plan:

* Zelensky has **not publicly attacked Witkoff personally**. Instead, he focuses on the **principles of any acceptable agreement**:

  * Borders must not be changed by force.
  * Ukraine must have real, durable security guarantees.
  * The deal must not sow the seeds of a future war. ([Al Jazeera][2])
* After the Geneva talks, Ukrainian and U.S. officials say the original **28-point draft was cut down to 19 points**, with Ukraine’s concerns partially addressed; Kyiv is said to have **“tentatively agreed in principle”** to a revised framework, with territorial issues kicked up to Trump and Zelensky personally. ([ABC News][10])

But inside Ukraine and its information space:

* Ukrainian outlets and Western-facing projects (NV, RBC-Ukraine, UA Crisis) highlight the leak as **proof that Witkoff is “on Russia’s side”**, which deepens domestic suspicion of both the plan and Trump’s intentions. ([RBC Ukraine][11])
* The calls are weaponised as evidence that Trump’s envoys are effectively **negotiating *with* Russia about what Ukraine must give up, and only then “selling” it to Kyiv**.

Kyiv’s leadership is stuck in a bind: publicly they can’t blow up the only active peace track with the U.S. president, but the leak makes it much harder to sell any compromise to a domestic audience that now has a transcript of Washington and Moscow gaming out their future borders over the phone.

### Moscow

Russia’s reaction is almost entirely about **narrative control**, not denial:

* **Ushakov** confirms the calls and complains that publishing conversations is an attempt “to interfere” and “hinder” relations with the U.S. ([AP News][3])
* Deputy FM **Sergei Ryabkov** calls the leak part of Western “hybrid war” and says it’s **“unacceptable”** – while also ruling out any **“significant concessions”** in the peace talks. ([Reuters][6])
* **Dmitry Peskov** says it’s premature to suggest a near-term deal and warns against overinterpreting media leaks. ([Newsweek][7])
* **Putin** himself says the revised U.S. blueprint “could lay the foundation for a final peace settlement,” but also threatens to seize more Ukrainian territory if Kyiv does not accept it – which, combined with battlefield advances in areas the plan hands to Russia, looks more like **leveraging talks to ratify gains** than genuine compromise. ([Al Jazeera][2])

So Moscow’s message is: *yes, we’re talking; no, we didn’t leak; and no, we’re not backing down on our maximalist demands*.

### EU and European leaders

The **loudest structural opposition** is coming from Europe:

* **Ursula von der Leyen**: any credible peace must

  * stop the killing,
  * **not change borders by force**,
  * avoid capping Ukraine’s military, and
  * keep the EU central to security guarantees. ([Al Jazeera][2])
* A joint statement at the G20 (UK, Canada, Finland, France, Spain, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Ireland) signals deep concern about:

  * rewarding Russia with territory,
  * shrinking Ukraine’s armed forces,
  * sidelining NATO and EU decision-making. ([Al Jazeera][2])
* **Macron** and **Kallas** go further: they stress that cutting Ukraine’s military and accepting Russian land grabs would **invite a future attack**; Macron explicitly says Russia will “come back” if there is no serious deterrence. ([Al Jazeera][2])

The leak itself is less central to EU messaging than the **substance it reveals**:

* The call confirms what Europeans already suspected: that the Trump team is **co-creating a plan with the Kremlin** that would lock in major Russian gains and reshape European security without full European input.
* It therefore reinforces the EU insistence that **they will not bless a peace deal that violates core principles**, even if it’s brokered by Washington.

## How serious is this, analytically?

If you strip away the noise, three structural points emerge:

### The leak confirms the “Russian wish-list” critique

Before the leak, critics could *suspect* the 28-point plan was heavily skewed towards Moscow. After the leak, there is direct evidence that:

* Russian officials openly talk about drafting the paper **from their maximum position**, and
* expect the final U.S. proposal to be “as close as possible” to that maximum. ([AP News][3])

That makes it much harder to sell the plan as a neutral U.S. attempt to balance interests.

### Witkoff’s role is no longer deniable

The calls show Witkoff is not just passively listening; he is:

* Actively **co-engineering the Kremlin’s approach to Trump** (wording, timing, flattery), and
* Signalling that he understands – and to some extent shares – Russia’s minimal conditions (keeping Donetsk and more). ([Reuters][12])

Whether you call that “standard deal-making” or “actual betrayal” is politics; factually, he’s **helping Russia package its position**.

### Politically, the leak raises the cost of any compromise

For Trump to succeed with this plan, he needs:

* Kyiv to accept painful concessions;
* Europeans to swallow a settlement that violates their stated red lines;
* U.S. Congress to go along with a deal seen as “ending the war”.

The leak:

* Hardens **U.S. congressional opposition**, including among Republicans;
* Gives **European leaders** more ammunition to say “this was shaped in Moscow”;
* Makes it politically harder for **Zelensky** to agree to anything resembling what Witkoff is discussing on tape.

In other words, even if the plan was sincere, the leak has **significantly reduced its viability** by exposing how it was made and who it really favours.
