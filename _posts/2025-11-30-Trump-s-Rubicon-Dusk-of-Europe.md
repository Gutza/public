# Trump’s Rubicon and the Dusk of Europe

I’ve systematically [tracked Russia’s war sustainability](https://gutza.github.io/public/2025-11-15-When-Will-Russia-Fall-November-Update) for months, measuring its economic resilience, manpower, and materiel, under the assumption was that mounting costs might eventually force Moscow to stand down. That assumption may become irrelevant if Putin secures a win at the negotiating table before Russia even reaches sustainment limits—never mind exhaustion.

So far, Putin hasn’t blinked: he managed to project an unwavering belief that time is on his side, and remains unwilling to compromise short of *[Ukrainian capitulation](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-analytical-report/russia-analytical-report-nov-17-24-2025#:~:text=,%E2%80%9Csuffered%20over%201%20million%20casualties)*. In other words, the Kremlin’s gambit has been to outlast Western resolve, and **Trump may be proving that gambit right**.

## A Gathering Storm: New Crises Triggering Alarm

Several *converging news developments* have prompted this analysis. First, **President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s political position in Ukraine has grown perilously fragile**. The strain of nearly four years of all-out war is showing: Ukraine faces manpower shortfalls, war fatigue, and even [corruption scandals at the highest levels](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/ukraine-corruption-and-u-s-interests-80d843d8). A [recent scandal in the energy sector](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/ukraine-corruption-and-u-s-interests-80d843d8) implicated people in Zelenskyy’s circle, damaging his reputation and fueling demands for sweeping changes in government. With Ukraine’s economy strained and casualties mounting, Zelenskyy has “[never been this vulnerable to pressure](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/11/24/under-pressure-from-washington-zelensky-faces-tough-choices_6747771_4.html#:~:text=These%20negotiations%20come%20at%20a,abroad%20is%20seen%20as%20insufficient),” as one opposition lawmaker observed. He himself warned Ukrainians that *“[the future of Ukraine could be decided in the coming days and weeks](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/11/24/under-pressure-from-washington-zelensky-faces-tough-choices_6747771_4.html#:~:text=Three%20and%20a%20half%20years,of%20losing%20a%20major%20partner)”*, framing the nation’s dilemma starkly as *“either the loss of dignity, or the risk of losing a major partner”*. In short, **Zelenskyy’s leverage is weakened** – exactly when U.S. pressure on him to accept a deal is peaking.

Second, on the battlefield, **Russia is on the verge of a potentially significant (if pyrrhic) victory in eastern Ukraine**. After months of brutal assault, Russian forces are close to capturing the *[strategic city of Pokrovsk](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia-gains-the-upper-hand-in-the-drone-battle-once-ukraines-forte-803d242e)* – a key logistics hub in Donetsk oblast. Ukrainian units have been stretched so thin that some positions were held by as few as **three soldiers**, and officers have reportedly questioned why fresh troops were sent to hold Pokrovsk “at all costs” when they considered the city *already lost*. The *fall of Pokrovsk*, likely imminent, would further dent Ukrainian morale and lend credence to the belief that Russia would prevail in a war of attrition. **Putin would undoubtedly seize on a Pokrovsk victory as proof that Ukrainian resistance is futile**, possibly **to convince Trump that Russia is “on a roll”** toward [inevitable triumph](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-is-running-out-of-timeand-men-11036585#:~:text=,International%20Crisis%20Group%2C%20told%20Newsweek). Even incremental Russian advances carry outsized psychological weight right now, as they coincide with Ukraine’s internal crisis and Western wavering.

Third, **[Russia’s drone warfare capabilities have markedly improved](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia-gains-the-upper-hand-in-the-drone-battle-once-ukraines-forte-803d242e)**, tipping the tactical balance in troubling ways. Moscow has adapted quickly – it can reportedly produce around *[35,000 Shahed kamikaze drones per year](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-analytical-report/russia-analytical-report-nov-17-24-2025#:~:text=5.%20Ground)* now, and has mastered new techniques like [first-person-view (FPV) attack drones](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia-gains-the-upper-hand-in-the-drone-battle-once-ukraines-forte-803d242e) that make any large gathering of troops an easy target. Ukrainian soldiers face “constant” drone and artillery strikes, forcing them to hunker down in camouflaged positions for weeks on end. Medical evacuation has grown *“[more dangerous and difficult than before](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-is-running-out-of-timeand-men-11036585#:~:text=trained%20reconnaissance%20units%20or%20even,than%20the%20classic%20infantry%20soldiers) because Russian drones can reach much further than [they could] in 2023 or 2024”*. This technological leap has sharply increased Ukrainian casualties and further strained their thin lines. It’s a reminder that **Russia is innovating to grind down Ukraine**, even as Western support plateaus. My running assessments of Russia’s economic and military sustainability always factored in potential degradation over time; yet by ramping up domestic drone production and *learning to fight smarter*, Putin has partially offset his deficits. He’s managed to *not* blink under pressure, doubling down on a long-war strategy.

Finally, and most critically, **we have the bombshell revelations from a recent [Wall Street Journal investigation](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/russia-u-s-peace-business-ties-4db9b290)** (echoed by multiple outlets) about *Putin’s plan to lure Trump through business deals disguised as “peace”*. President Trump’s envoys – notably real estate mogul **Steve Witkoff** (a close Trump ally with no diplomatic background) and **Jared Kushner** have been **negotiating with Russian officials to structure a post-war economic bonanza**. According to that reporting, **[profit, not peace, is at the center of Trump’s proposed settlement](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/russia-u-s-peace-business-ties-4db9b290)**. Witkoff openly spoke of a future where *Russia, the U.S., and Ukraine are all business partners*, envisioning joint ventures that make “everybody prosper,” which he claims would naturally help prevent future conflict. In practice this means **revitalizing Russia’s $2 trillion economy through U.S.-Russian ventures**, fueled by some $300 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets that would be unlocked for *U.S. businesses* to invest in Russia and to ostensibly fund Ukraine’s reconstruction. The audacity is breathtaking: **Putin’s emissaries (like Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund) have dangled [lucrative deals](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/russia-u-s-peace-business-ties-4db9b290) – from exploiting Arctic minerals to partnering with SpaceX for a joint Mars mission – to entice Trump’s circle**. And Trump-linked financiers are already circling these opportunities: one friend of Donald Trump Jr. is in talks to buy into a Russian Arctic gas project if sanctions are lifted, while a major Trump donor has been working with Trump’s son to potentially *acquire the Russia-to-Germany [Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/russia-u-s-peace-business-ties-4db9b290)*. In short, *American oligarchs* close to Trump stand to make a killing *alongside Putin's Russian oligarchs*.

The **strategic implications of this “peace-for-profit” scheme are dire**. By co-opting U.S. business elites, *Moscow believes it can drive a wedge between the U.S. and its European allies*. Indeed, the Journal’s reporting noted that **Russia’s goal is to become an economic powerhouse in Europe through partnership with a Trump-led America, thereby isolating Europe**. European leaders have reacted with barely concealed alarm. Trump’s initial 28-point peace plan (drafted by Witkoff *based on a Russian proposal*) was seen as **blatantly generous to Moscow – requiring Ukraine to concede territory and neuter its military, essentially surrendering sovereignty**. One European official described it as *“selling out Ukraine, Europe and the US for [Trump’s team’s] own personal interests.”*

Europe’s major powers quickly put forward their **own counter-proposal** to blunt the worst aspects of Trump’s draft, but cracks in European unity are already widening dangerously. While the EU leadership scrambles to offer alternatives, **Belgium’s Prime Minister Bart De Wever has effectively blocked the EU’s plan to use frozen Russian assets for Ukraine’s reconstruction**. In a harsh letter to Brussels, he warned such a move was legally perilous, forcing the bloc to desperately seek a "Plan B" merely to keep Kyiv solvent into early 2026. This financial disarray severely [undercuts Europe's leverage](https://www.euronews.ro/articole/ue-ia-in-considerare-planul-b-pentru-ucraina-prim-ministrul-belgian-critica-dur-p) just as Washington pushes its own agenda. Meanwhile, Moscow swiftly rejected the European amendments, and Washington’s response to Europe’s input has been muted at best.

It’s this combination of factors – **a weakened Ukraine, a Russia making incremental gains and dangling honeyed deals, and a U.S. president fixated on transactional “deals” over strategic principles** – that sets the stage for a potentially *catastrophic shift* in Europe’s security landscape.

## The Hinges of Fate: If These Premises Hold…

If all of the above holds true – *and if Trump’s priorities are indeed what they appear to be* – then **Europe may soon find itself in a singularly dangerous position**. Consider the emerging picture: Ukraine’s leadership is under duress and might be coerced into an unfavorable ceasefire; Russia, at great cost, is *just* strong enough to compel concessions while promising riches to a deal-minded Washington; and Trump is signalling that *“the future stability of Europe is secondary”* to striking an agreement that he can brand as [“ending the war”](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-analytical-report/russia-analytical-report-nov-17-24-2025#:~:text=militarily%20and%20politically%2C%20they%20think,%E2%80%9D).

At the heart of this drama are **irreconcilable strategic priorities**. **Europe’s core priority** in this war has always been clear: **Russia’s aggression must not be rewarded** – Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity need to be upheld, not bartered away. European nations (especially those on Russia’s periphery) see the war as existential for the post-1945 international order; allowing Moscow to **slice off Ukrainian land and face no consequences** would set a perilous precedent and directly threaten Europe’s own security by providing Russia with permanent, strategic access to the Black Sea via its newly-conquered land corridor cutting through Eastern Ukraine straight to Crimea. Europe also insists on *justice* – accountability for the atrocities committed during the invasion – rather than sweeping them under the rug of a [quick deal](https://kyivindependent.com/the-light-ukraine-cannot-lose-justice/#:~:text=The%20plan%20demands%20enormous%20concessions,crimes%20committed%20on%20its%20territory). In short, Europe’s stance is that any peace must be *just and lasting*, not a cynical pause that validates one more of Putin’s land-grabs and invites the next attack.

**Trump’s apparent priorities, however, diverge starkly**. By all indications, Trump approaches the Ukraine war less as a strategic move or a test of the free world’s resolve, and more as **a business deal to be closed swiftly**. *“[Stopping the war is a business deal](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-analytical-report/russia-analytical-report-nov-17-24-2025#:~:text=,suit%20what%20he%20sees%20as),”* as one observer noted – and Trump’s team seems to think Zelenskyy should “sell” by agreeing to a quick pact largely on Putin’s terms. The *hard truth* is that in **Trump’s calculus, profits and an expedient halt to fighting outweigh European security concerns**. Hints of this mindset surfaced even in Trump’s rhetoric: early in 2025 he berated Zelenskyy in person, shouting that Ukraine *“did not have the cards”* to bargain and would have to make [big concessions](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-is-running-out-of-timeand-men-11036585#:~:text=Trump%2C%20a%20frequent%20critic%20of,from%20a%20position%20of%20strength). Though he momentarily flattered Europeans by suggesting Ukraine *might* win, he soon swung back to arguing Ukraine must cede territory – a U-turn apparently prompted by *“signals from Moscow”* that Putin was ready to deal.

In essence, **Trump’s vision of “peace” crosses every red line that Ukraine and Europe have**. It would force Ukraine to relinquish huge swathes of land (Crimea and the Donbas at a minimum), drastically scale down its army, and abandon its [NATO aspirations](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-is-running-out-of-timeand-men-11036585#:~:text=than%20any%20new%20analysis%20of,the%20battlefield). Those terms map uncannily to Putin’s maximalist demands and **are “entirely unacceptable to Ukraine” and to Europe – a Faustian bargain that violates principles both have upheld alongside the US ever since the end of World War II**. European diplomats privately liken Trump’s plan to appeasement: *former French President François Hollande warned that it “reduces Europe’s role to a besieged bystander,”* and former U.S. officials like Fiona Hill have said *Washington is effectively handing Moscow [tremendous influence over Europe’s future](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-analytical-report/russia-analytical-report-nov-17-24-2025#:~:text=steroids%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20wrote.%20,The%20Ukraine%20deal%20has%20the)*.

If Trump prioritizes *“bringing Russia back into the global economy”* and securing American profit share over punishing aggression, he will be **crossing the Rubicon** in transatlantic relations. His *Rubicon*—a point of no return—is the abandonment of the security guarantees and values that undergird NATO and the EU alliance. It would be the first time since World War II that a U.S. president openly undercuts European security for short-term gain. A senior European official, aghast at the prospect, described Trump’s approach as *“realpolitik on steroids”* and cautioned that *Trump would ‘live in infamy’ if he forces Ukraine to sell its sovereignty to suit what he sees as [America’s interests](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-analytical-report/russia-analytical-report-nov-17-24-2025#:~:text=,suit%20what%20he%20sees%20as)*.

Let’s be explicit: **Trump’s Rubicon is the betrayal of Europe.** It would mean **forsaking the foundational promise of NATO’s Article 5 (“an attack on one is an attack on all”) and the decades-long U.S. pledge to uphold Europe’s peace and freedom**. While Trump has never said he’d quit NATO, his actions speak loudly. By coercing Ukraine into a lopsided peace that grants Putin much of what he wants, Trump would be signaling that U.S. commitments are negotiable and that *might makes right*, after all. European officials fear that if Washington effectively sides with Moscow’s perspective in Ukraine, **Europe could be left “besieged,” alone to face a revanchist Kremlin**. *The trust, painstakingly built over 75 years of US diplomacy, that America will have Europe’s back could be irrevocably damaged*. East European countries from Poland to the Baltics would hear the message loud and clear: **they may have to fend for themselves** in any future showdown with Russia. Even Western European powers would see their global clout diminished if the transatlantic bond fractures.

This isn’t just conjecture. We’re already seeing early signs of estrangement. European leaders have been *incredulous* at Trump’s dealings: they complain that **Washington drafted its Ukraine peace plan by consulting Moscow first and allies second**, relegating Europe to scrambling in reaction. The *Guardian* reported that U.S. officials had to promise an “updated” peace framework only after a backlash from European capitals who [felt sidelined](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/23/trump-ukraine-zero-gratitude-peace-plan-international-talks#:~:text=US%20and%20Ukraine%20promise%20%27updated%27,hours%20after%20European%20countries). In Brussels and Berlin, policy makers are gaming out worst-case scenarios: What if the U.S. lifts sanctions on Russia while Europe keeps them? What if Trump strikes some energy deal with Putin that leaves Europe in the cold? **The hinges of history seem to be creaking**: if an American president forsakes common cause with Europe in favor of partnership with Putin, we enter a new and perilous era.

## The Nightmare Scenario: How Darkness Falls

It’s now time to paint the **nightmare scenario** explicitly, to spring the trap that all these developments have baited. If Trump crosses that Rubicon, **Europe stands on the brink of a modern dark age (even if temporary)**. And events could degrade **far faster than many imagine – conceivably within a month or two**, with momentous, irreversible swings in 2025. Here’s how it could unfold:

1. **A Forced Ceasefire on Russia’s Terms:** Under intensifying pressure from Washington, Zelenskyy feels he has no choice but to accept a ceasefire framework heavily favoring Moscow. With U.S. intelligence support and military aid on the line, Kyiv reluctantly swallows a deal that freezes front lines where they are, with Russian forces deep into Ukrainian territory. In this scenario, by mid-December 2025 **a preliminary peace agreement is signed**. It likely entails Ukraine formally ceding Crimea and occupied parts of Donetsk/Luhansk to Russia (or labeling them *“neutral zones”* that in practice fall under Moscow’s control). Ukraine might also have to demobilize hundreds of thousands of troops and accept a cap on its armed forces, as Trump’s plan envisioned. All of this would happen *without Russia being forced to withdraw its army from Ukrainian soil*. For Putin, this would be a triumph sealed by U.S. diplomatic fiat.

2. **Zelenskyy’s Fall and Kyiv in Turmoil:** Such a deal would be politically radioactive in Ukraine. Zelenskyy knows it – he has repeatedly vowed not to *“[betray](https://www.instagram.com/politicoeurope/p/DRUQANEEnzw/#:~:text=European%20and%20Ukrainian%20officials%20have,point%20plan%20would)” Ukraine* or its fallen heroes by capitulating on sovereignty. Yet in this nightmare scenario, he is cornered. Perhaps he tries to sell the deal as the only way to “stop the killing.” Still, within days there is uproar in the Rada (parliament) and on the streets of Kyiv. Wartime censorship and fatigue may prevent mass protests, but **rumblings of a political earthquake** grow. Hardline elements in the military feel **betrayed** – they sacrificed dearly only to see politicians give up land they still hold. There’s talk of a possible split: some officers might refuse an order to withdraw from positions, echoing the **warning that a premature territorial concession could “[rupture civil-military relations](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/11/24/under-pressure-from-washington-zelensky-faces-tough-choices_6747771_4.html#:~:text=An%20unknown)”**. If Zelenskyy agrees to Russian terms, he could be forced to resign or be ousted in favor of an emergency government (perhaps led by the military or a coalition including opposition figures). If he refuses the deal, Trump’s White House might cut off all support immediately, leading to a rapid Ukrainian collapse at the front. **Either outcome is chaotic**: a constitutional crisis in Kyiv, or a sudden military breakdown – or both.

3. **Western Unity Collapses:** In Washington, Trump declares he’s achieved *“peace with honor”* (though it’s anything but). He moves to unfreeze Russian assets and urges U.S. companies to dive into those joint ventures [dangled by Putin](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/russia-u-s-peace-business-ties-4db9b290). European allies are stunned. Some, like Hungary’s **Viktor Orbán**, have already defected. Orbán brazenly visited Moscow on November 28 to secure Russian energy deals and discuss "peace" directly with Putin, emboldened by a fresh U.S. sanctions [exemption granted by the Trump administration](https://www.euronews.ro/articole/orban-se-intalneste-vineri-cu-putin-la-moscova-pentru-a-discuta-despre-energie-si). But most European leaders, especially in Eastern Europe, react with **horror and a sense of betrayal**. Poland, the Baltic states, Finland – countries that feel directly threatened by an emboldened Russia – may refuse to endorse the ceasefire. We could witness NATO’s eastern flank nations openly break with a U.S. president’s position, an unprecedented schism. Poland might even try to continue military assistance to Ukraine unilaterally, or in concert with willing European partners, *defying* the U.S.-Russia deal – but without American logistics or supplies, such efforts would be hard to sustain. Meanwhile Germany and France face a wrenching dilemma: follow the U.S. lead and remove sanctions per Trump’s new policy, or hold the line against Russia alone (which would wreak havoc on European economies if U.S. goes its own way). **The once rock-solid Western front against Putin shatters**.

4. **Russia Ascendant and Europe Exposed:** Putin, smelling blood, likely doesn’t sit idle. Even as he attends signing ceremonies and smiles for photo-ops with Trump, he could quietly reinforce positions and perhaps continue low-level offensives under the guise of “mopping up terrorists” (since any Ukrainian partisans resisting in ceded areas would be branded as such). The *Wall Street Journal* reported Putin’s regime sees *even a temporary peace as a chance to supercharge Russia’s power in Europe while the U.S. is turned inward on profit*. Indeed, as sanctions are lifted, Russian coffers refill. Within weeks, Russian oil and gas shipments surge under lucrative new contracts, while much-needed technological imports start flowing in – perhaps with American middlemen taking a cut, while Europe’s leverage via sanctions evaporates. Russia swiftly regains influence in European energy markets, making Europe **more vulnerable to political pressure** (a Kremlin wedge strategy that had been disrupted by the war is now back in play). And critically, NATO’s credibility is in tatters. Putin may not invade a NATO country outright (he’s always been cautious about crossing that line), but he doesn’t need to – instead, Russia can escalate hybrid warfare: massive cyber attacks on European infrastructure, or stoking conflicts in the Balkans, knowing that a paralyzed NATO will struggle to respond. *Europe enters a period of strategic twilight*. The American security umbrella, long taken for granted, truly vanishes almost overnight, and Europe’s own defense initiatives – which were always complementary to NATO, not a replacement – cannot be stood up fast enough to plug the gap.

5. **Spillover: The EU and Domestic Discord:** In this nightmare scenario, the EU itself faces internal strain as member states diverge sharply on how to handle the new reality. Governments that aligned with Trump’s perspective (perhaps an Italy or others with strong populist opposition) might argue for accommodating Russia and moving on. Others, like Poland, will likely call for massively increased defense spending and perhaps an EU-wide deterrence strategy (even hinting at developing independent nuclear deterrence if U.S. protection is gone). The rift could tear at the fabric of the Union. Economically, a sudden lifting of U.S. Russia sanctions but continuation of EU sanctions (if Brussels resists Trump’s path) could lead to bizarre outcomes – U.S. firms racing into Russia for contracts while European firms are still banned, disadvantaging Europe’s economy (an outcome Trump would likely consider a strategic win for the US within his MAGA framework, something explicitly mentioned in the [WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/russia-u-s-peace-business-ties-4db9b290#:~:text=beat%20European%20competitors%20to%20the%20dividends)). Pressure would mount on Europe to also lift sanctions to avoid being left behind. If Europe capitulates on sanctions too, then truly **Putin emerges victorious**: he would have shattered Western unity *and* escaped punishment, all while keeping Ukrainian land and facing a divided, demoralized Europe. European publics, watching this unfold, could lose faith in their establishments. The far-right and pro-Kremlin political forces would be emboldened, claiming they were right all along about America’s perfidy and the need for a European “third way.” We could see, in short order, **political upheavals in multiple European countries**, compounding the strategic crisis.

To sum up, the nightmare scenario is one of *rapid, cascading destabilization*: a coerced peace in Ukraine that acts as a geopolitical earthquake, fracturing alliances, and leaving Europe exposed to a revanchist power just when it’s most divided and disillusioned. The **“dusk of Europe”** in this context means the end of the relatively sunny post-Cold War era—plunging into a period of uncertainty, fear, and the shadow of authoritarian aggression, not unlike the darkest chapters of the 20th century. And as hyperbolic as that may sound, it is **not far-fetched if current trajectories are not somehow corrected**.

How fast could this unravel? Disturbingly fast. The diplomatic talks in Geneva, brokered by Trump’s team, are ongoing as we speak. Trump’s special envoy Witkoff has returned to Moscow, and the President himself has declared on Truth Social that a deal is "very close," with negotiators reportedly reaching a "common understanding" on [major terms](https://www.biziday.ro/339907-2/). Zelenskyy is expected in Washington within days to put the "final touches" on a framework that looks increasingly like a fait accompli. European diplomats privately fear the agreement could be presented by Christmas. Once inked, events would move into fast-forward: immediate implementation of terms and partial lifting of sanctions as early as January 2026, with all the aforementioned consequences starting to manifest.

## What Must Happen for the Nightmare to Come True? (Conditions & Probabilities)

Several key **conditions** would need to align for this worst-case scenario to fully materialize. Let’s recap them, along with an assessment of how likely each is, based on current information:

- **Trump doubles down on a deal-at-all-costs approach (High Probability):** All signals indicate that President Trump is indeed pursuing a *“peace” deal focused on quick gains and business interests over allied concerns*. His negotiators have been [coordinating with the Kremlin behind the scenes](https://kyivindependent.com/outrage-disgust-but-little-surprise-ukraine-reacts-to-bombshell-witkoff-leak/#:~:text=In%20one%20of%20the%20conversations,a%20collection%20of%20Russian%20demands), and leaks show Witkoff even *coaching* Russian aides on how to sell the plan to Trump as if it were their own. Trump’s own remarks (dismissing criticism of Witkoff’s backchannels as “standard” and emphasizing the need for Ukraine to “sell” the deal) reinforce this. Therefore this condition – that Trump is willing to cross traditional lines to clinch a deal – appears firmly in place. **The probability that Trump will prioritize his Rubicon-crossing deal over Europe’s objections is high.**

- **Putin maintains pressure and offers just enough carrot (High Probability):** For the nightmare scenario, Putin must continue to neither crumble militarily nor compromise politically – and he hasn’t. Militarily, Russia is still grinding forward in places like Pokrovsk, at terrible cost but with relentless persistence. Putin has also shown he’s willing to **escalate pain to Ukrainian civilians (e.g. renewed strikes causing blackouts) to increase urgency for peace on his terms**. Politically, he’s staying mostly quiet publicly on the talks (keeping everyone guessing), but through envoys like Dmitriev he’s dangling huge [economic incentives to the Americans](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/russia-u-s-peace-business-ties-4db9b290). He’s effectively telling Trump: *we can both win, ignore the Europeans.* Given Putin’s track record and current stance, it’s *highly likely* he’ll keep this twin strategy of pressure and allure going. He believes, as CIA’s Bill Burns put it, that *“time is on his side”* and he’s certainly **“[not ready for a serious negotiation – only capitulation](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-analytical-report/russia-analytical-report-nov-17-24-2025#:~:text=,%E2%80%9Csuffered%20over%201%20million%20casualties)”** (meaning he will hold out for maximal terms). Thus, **the probability of Putin continuing to *not blink* and to exploit this moment is high.**

- **Ukraine (Zelenskyy) is compelled to acquiesce (Medium Probability):** This is perhaps the most uncertain hinge. Zelenskyy is weakened, yes, and under extreme pressure. U.S. officials are essentially giving him an ultimatum: accept a compromised peace or lose vital support. However, **will Zelenskyy actually sign on the dotted line?** He has shown resilience and stubbornness in the past. Publicly, he continues to insist he won’t barter away Ukrainian land or dignity. Domestically, his opponents (and even members of his party) have warned against a humiliating deal. That said, if faced with the cutoff of U.S. aid, even Zelenskyy might yield – or be replaced by someone who will. I assess this as **medium probability**: it is quite possible (maybe even more likely than not) that Ukraine will grudgingly go along with a U.S.-imposed ceasefire in the near term, *but it’s not a certainty*. There’s a scenario where Kyiv resists to the last moment, hoping U.S. politics or European intervention change the calculus. Still, the **moment of decision is imminent**, and Ukrainian officials are already deeply engaged in shaping the “updated framework” alongside U.S. negotiators. The likely outcome is a reluctant *yes* from Kyiv on paper – the question is only how far they can adjust the terms.

- **European Allies cannot block or counter the deal (High Probability):** Realistically, Europe lacks the means to stop an America that’s determined to go its own way. European leaders can protest, propose counter-plans, and warn of the consequences – as they have done – but if Trump decides to move, Europe cannot override the U.S.-Russia consensus. The EU has no magic wand to support Ukraine without U.S. help; European NATO members, despite significant aid to Ukraine, still rely on U.S. intelligence, logistics, and weapons for sustaining the war effort. Europe’s leverage over Trump is minimal (they’ve tried flattery and reason; neither seems effective). Moreover, **Europe is not entirely united internally**, which undercuts its influence. While France, Germany, Poland, etc., are all alarmed by Trump’s approach, some outliers (Hungary’s government, for example) are nearer to Trump’s and Putin’s line. This disunity makes a decisive European pushback less likely. Therefore, **the probability is high that Europe will be unable to prevent the implementation of Trump’s deal**. They may succeed only in marginally modifying it or delaying it, but *not* in fundamentally derailing it.

- **Rapid Implementation and Irreversible Changes (Medium-High Probability):** For the nightmare to fully unfold, the deal’s execution must be swift and its effects hard to reverse. Signs point to that being the plan – Trump’s team is in a hurry (“there’s no reason for waiting,” Trump said, pushing even to [shorten a negotiating deadline](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-russia-pressure-menu-options-to-convince-putin-to-negotiate-on-ukraine/#:~:text=US%20President%20Donald%20Trump%20just,waiting%2C%E2%80%9D%20Trump%20said%20on%20Monday) from 50 days to 10 in one instance). If an agreement is reached, expect Trump to immediately ease some sanctions via executive order and pressure Congress to free up those frozen funds for the business ventures. Likewise, Russia would quickly formalize whatever “neutral zones” or annexations are agreed upon, maybe even move to deploy border guards or officials to those areas, creating new facts on the ground. Could a later U.S. administration or European coalition roll back such a deal? Possibly in theory, but in practice once sanctions are lifted and money flows, it’s *very difficult* to snap back – companies create vested interests in continued engagement. Territorial concessions, once codified, are exceedingly hard to undo without war. So, I’d rate it **medium-high probability** that the changes triggered by a rushed deal in late 2025 become effectively permanent (or at least lasting enough to mark a strategic inflection). The biggest uncertainty here is **domestic U.S. politics**: if there is widespread backlash among Americans (and notably from both Democrats and key Republicans who have criticized [Trump’s pro-Russia tilt](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/russia-u-s-peace-business-ties-4db9b290)), implementation might hit some domestic roadblocks. But given Trump’s grip on his party’s base and the urgency he’s projecting, those opposition voices may not muster enough power to delay the train.

In summary, **most of the necessary pieces for this nightmare scenario are either in place or trending in that direction**. The **highest-risk elements (Trump’s determination and Putin’s opportunism) are essentially certain**, and the main variable is how Ukraine and Europe respond under duress – so far, neither have found an effective way to alter the overarching trajectory. Unless something dramatic changes, the conditions for Europe’s worst fears appear to be converging before our eyes.

## A Sobering Crossroad for Europe

We are, without exaggeration, at one of the most **critical junctures for Europe’s future** since at least the end of the Cold War – perhaps even since WWII. The coming weeks may well determine the continent’s trajectory for a generation or more. If the nightmare scenario sketched above comes to pass, it would mark **a historic inflection point**: America’s retreat from its leadership role in Europe, the unraveling of the post-1991 security order, and a triumph of authoritarian power politics on European soil. It would signal dusk falling on an era of relative peace and collective security, ushering in a darker time of division and danger.

This is not the outcome any of us watching this tragedy unfold want to see. Yet being clear-eyed and *analytical*, we must acknowledge how close it is now. The “**Rubicon**” metaphor is apt – once crossed, there is no going back. Trump’s choice (and by extension America’s choice) in the immediate term will either reassure allies that the U.S. remains committed to shared values and security – or it will shatter that trust possibly beyond repair. For Europe, the stakes could not be higher.

In the closing chapters of 2025, Europe faces a test of unity and resolve under unprecedented stress. European leaders will need to coordinate as never before, **contingency-planning for the worst while striving to mitigate it**. There may yet be a narrow path to avert the most disastrous outcomes – through diplomatic finesse, public pressure, or even last-minute adjustments by the U.S. administration in response to criticism. But as of now, Europeans must brace for the very real possibility that they will soon be navigating a far more hostile world largely on their own. **The next few weeks will be pivotal**. We will either remember late 2025 as the time when Western democracies stood firm and found a way to uphold the principles that have kept Europe free – or as the moment the lights began to dim, the dusk that preluded a long, uncertain night.

Either way, the responsibility on today’s statesmen and women is immense. History is taking shape in real time at the Geneva negotiation tables and in transatlantic phone calls. For Europe, this is a moment to **stay vigilant, united, and clear in its red lines** – to impress upon Washington that some compromises are too dangerous to accept. Because if Trump does cross this Rubicon, the **“Dusk of Europe”** may indeed descend, and recovering from it will be the work of decades, if it is possible at all. The *window to prevent that scenario is closing fast*. These coming weeks may well prove decisive in charting whether Europe’s future is one of continued twilight or a descent into darkness.
