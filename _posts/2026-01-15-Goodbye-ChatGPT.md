# Leaving ChatGPT: The How

For reasons too many to bother you with, I'm leaving ChatGPT. This piece is not about the _why_ or the _where to_, it's about the _how_.

I live in the EU, where they actually try to force corporations to allow us peons to move our data across service providers. Service providers, on the other hand, do everything they can to turn us to [digital serfs](https://youtu.be/rqR7z2eHOBE), so the "export data" function is a joke. Thing is, my ChatGPT subscription expires tomorrow, so I vibe coded a [very basic ChatGPT chat exporter](https://github.com/Gutza/Goodbye-ChatGPT). HTH.

> **P.S.**: It turns out OpenAI allows the same export functionality for [all peons worldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers_of_the_world,_unite!); **I suggest you use their export functionality** alongside my (very Spartan) scripts, because my scripts don't download your rich media files (images and audio files; I don't even know if their export contains generated video files, I never used Sora and friends).
