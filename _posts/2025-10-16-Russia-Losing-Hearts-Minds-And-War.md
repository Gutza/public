# Russia Losing Hearts & Minds (Plus the War)

This is part of a personal project I started back in June to track the sustainment of Russia's war effort. I originally planned to only release monthly updates, but since my [post last week](https://gutza.github.io/public/2025-10-08-When-Will-Russia-Fall-October-Update), I felt that overall sentiment shifted significantly enough to warrant an update. This post continues my sustainment log: not who advanced 300 meters over the past 24 hours, but rather zooming out to estimate when the Kremlin will no longer be able to afford to keep fighting at scale.

There's a famous Hemingway quote answering the question "*How did you go bankrupt?*": "*Gradually, then suddenly.*" I think Russia just shifted from "gradually" to "suddenly" this week. Refineries keep burning, crude gets pushed out cheaper and riskier, the deficit grows more expensive to fund, Russia is flailing in its geopolitical influence, and the labor market is held together with reservist paperwork and bonuses—and global public sentiment is turning against Russia, fast.

## What changed this week

**Deep strikes are landing where it hurts.** Ukraine’s drones hit **Ufa (Bashneft/UNPZ)** and reportedly **Saratov** again, on top of **Kirishi’s** big unit going offline earlier this month. Multiple datasets put Russia’s *effective* hit to refining at **~17–21% at peaks** since August—ignore the inflated 38% memes; capacity ≠ output. Either way, the symptom set is real: **export bans, rationing, and emergency imports** from Belarus/Asia. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-kirishi-refinery-halts-largest-unit-after-drone-attack-sources-say-2025-10-06/), [Reuters graphic](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/UKRAINE-CRISIS/RUSSIA-ENERGY/gdpzbxkgwpw/), [AP](https://apnews.com/article/4de5965f6716f9234f0c000da091eeeb))

**Crude out, margin down, risk up.** With product output crimped, Russia shoved **crude exports via western ports up ~25% m/m in September**, leaning harder on Novorossiisk—a port now near capacity, exposed to drones and weather. More barrels moving on a **sanctions-watched, storm-prone route** is a sign of fragility. ([Reuters – exports](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russias-western-port-oil-exports-up-25-after-drone-attacks-2025-10-01/), [Reuters – Novorossiisk strain](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/storms-drone-attacks-record-oil-exports-pile-pressure-russian-port-novorossiisk-2025-10-15/))

**Sanctions bite smarter.** London blacklisted **Rosneft, Lukoil and 44 shadow-fleet tankers**, plus nodes tied to India/China—an attack on the shipping/insurance plumbing that makes every marginal barrel pricier. In the Balkans, U.S. measures finally **cut Serbia’s Gazprom-controlled NIS off JANAF**, threatening the **Pančevo** refinery—a small volume, big symbolism loss of a Russian downstream beachhead inside Europe. ([Reuters – UK list](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-expands-russia-sanctions-with-90-new-listings-2025-10-15/), [Reuters – NIS/JANAF](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/serbias-russian-owned-oil-firm-nis-faces-us-sanctions-waiver-expires-2025-10-09/))

**Europe is moving from pledges to pipelines.** NATO allies activated a **PURL** workaround: **buy U.S. systems (esp. Patriot interceptors) and pass them to Ukraine** to stabilize air-defense magazines through winter. In parallel, **Skyranger 35** on **Leopard 1** gives Ukraine a cheaper anti-drone layer; programmable AHEAD rounds flip the **cost curve** back against Shaheds.

**Macro room shrank another notch.** The **IMF** cut 2025 growth to **0.6%**; the central bank sits at **17%**; inflation is sticky with a gasoline kicker. Debt service is headed toward a fatter slice of spending in 2026. The **NWF** headline (₽13.16T) still looks cushy; the **liquid** slice (last solid print ≈ **₽4T**) is what pays real bills.

**Manpower by euphemism.** No new mass mobilization decree—but **expanded use of active reservists** and a drumbeat of incentives signal the same reality: casualties must be replaced while the civilian economy reports **furloughs/shorter workweeks**. ([RFE/RL](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine-reservists-putin-defense-ministry-amendments/33559909.html), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-industrial-titans-furlough-workers-its-war-economy-stalls-2025-10-09/))

**Diplomatic oxygen thinner.** Moscow **postponed its Russia–Arab summit** for lack of top-tier attendance. Meanwhile, Europe locks in **Azeri gas** via SEFE–SOCAR, and the EU moves closer to **using frozen Russian assets**—a structural funding/energy shift, not a press release. ([Bloomberg – summit](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-10/putin-scraps-summit-over-lack-of-attendance-from-arab-leaders), [Bloomberg – SEFE/SOCAR](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-09/germany-s-sefe-to-announce-10-year-deal-for-gas-from-azerbaijan), [Reuters – assets](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/britain-france-germany-move-closer-giving-russian-assets-ukraine-2025-10-10/))

## The counter-argument

You’ll hear the line—almost certainly born of Kremlin PR—*“careful predicting Russia will fall: Napoleon and Hitler made the same mistake!”*

That sounds clever but misidentifies the common factor. **The constant isn’t Russia; it’s aggression plus hubris**—leaders convinced they could “*kick in the door and the whole rotten structure would come crashing down*” (that's Hitler famously miscalculating USSR's resilience, eerily prescient of Putin's own miscalculation of Ukraine's "three days to fall").

By the numbers:

1. **Then Russia was the defender; now it’s the aggressor.**
   Napoleon and Hitler overreached into a vast theatre with brittle logistics and fantasy timelines. In 2022, **Putin** ran the same overreach **outward**—a three-day plan for Kyiv that met a state prepared to resist. The recurring mindset is the invader’s rotten-door illusion, not Russia’s mystical resilience.

2. **History’s lesson isn’t “Russia always wins”; it’s “overconfident invasions bleed out.”**
   The pattern is boring and brutal: **bad assumptions → long war → attrition → political-economic strain.** That is the curve Moscow is riding now.

3. **Today’s structure punishes the aggressor even more.**
   Napoleon and Hitler didn’t face **global sanctions on finance, shipping insurance, semiconductors, and energy logistics**—or a Ukraine plugged into a **NATO industrial base** for air defense, drones, and intel. Those are compounding multipliers on the attacker’s cost curve.

The analogy, properly applied, actually flips the script and indicts **Putin’s** gamble—not forecasts of Russian invincibility. The hubris is the constant; the bill arrives later.

## What to watch (one-week tests)

* **Output, not nameplate:** Are **Kirishi/Saratov/Ufa** back at meaningful throughput, or do policy tells (export bans, imports) persist?
* **Port friction:** Any **detentions/insurance refusals/STS delays** after the UK listings? Does **Novorossiisk** slip under weather or drones?
* **OFZ prints:** Consecutive auctions at **≥15%** would push our “financing pain” tripwire toward **ON**.
* **NWF (liquid) update:** If the sellable cushion trends toward **₽2–3T**, that’s a real red line.
* **AD magazines:** Evidence that **PURL** is filling Patriot stocks and **Skyranger** is fielded—i.e., the **cost curve on defense** is bending.

My base window from October stands—**late-2025 to mid-2026** for a sustainment break absent a major lifeline, with a probability skew towards 2025—except *the emperor's new clothes are starting to show*.
