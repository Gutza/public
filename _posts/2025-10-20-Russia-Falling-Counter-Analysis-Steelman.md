# Russia Falling Counter-Analysis: Steelman

> *This is a reactions piece to the fresh wave of Russia-doesn't-fall-so-easily takes on the recent shift in perspective—using Money & Macro’s video [Why Russia's war economy is stronger than you think][1] as the best-articulated version. It’s a steelman, then a stress test. For context, see my Oct 16 sustainment note, where I argued Russia just shifted from “gradually” to “suddenly” on structural strain.* ([Russia Losing Hearts & Minds (Plus the War)](https://gutza.github.io/public/2025-10-16-Russia-Losing-Hearts-Minds-And-War))

## TL;DR
The steelman says “no collapse.” I agree—and also say “**that’s not the bar**.” The bar is whether Russia can **sustain** a high-intensity war while its energy/logistics backbone is degraded and its fiscal room narrows. On that narrower, harsher test, the evidence keeps bending one way.

## What the video argues (fair summary)

* **War-economy basics explain the upside.** Mobilization + deficit spending pulled idle labor and machines into use, lifting GDP and even *reported* life satisfaction in early phases. The first-order effect doesn’t have to be inflationary if output rises with money.
* **Collapse channels are mostly sealed off.** Capital flight? Blunted by capital controls. Import blockades? Unlikely given food/energy self-sufficiency and China/India ties. Debt crisis? Hard when public and household debt are low. Morale? Authoritarian systems can tolerate a lot of pain. (Capital controls 2022/2023: Reuters.) ([Reuters][2])
* **“Phase Two” is available.** Russia has *so far* used few truly oppressive tools (beyond FX controls). If needed, the state can shift civilian slack into the war machine via wider price/wage controls. (Food price caps under discussion: Moscow Times.) ([The Moscow Times][3])
* **Compared to historic war economies, Russia isn’t maxed out.** The video’s chart shows Russia’s war spend/GDP well below the U.S. in Vietnam, the late-USSR, and Nazi Germany—implying room to tighten before a breaking point. For today, Russia’s own budget papers put 2025 “national defence” around **~6.3% of GDP**. (Reuters; OMB/CIA/Harrison for comparators.) ([Reuters][4])

**Bottom line (their view):** Waiting for an economic collapse is a fantasy; only bigger Western support and smarter sanctions alter the trajectory.

## Fit with my running analysis (quick read)

Broadly, **their “Phase One” story is true**—and it fooled a lot of forecasters. Where we diverge is **what matters now**:

* The video underweights **physical damage on the home front** (refineries, ports, rail, gas processing): that’s *not* typical of Vietnam-era USA or the late-USSR—and it is now consistent and compounding. (Reuters series on refinery hits; Kirishi shutdown; Orenburg gas plant strike.) ([Reuters][5])
* It glosses over **financing friction**: high rates, rising interest costs, shrinking liquid buffers, and a tax turn that pushes pain onto households. (VAT to 22% in 2026; deficit to ~2.6%/GDP; liquid NWF ≈ ₽4.17T.) ([Reuters][6])
* On **opinion data**, the piece treats record life-satisfaction as signal. In an authoritarian setting with rising repression, **response bias** and self-selection are first-order issues—Levada itself cautions on survey limits. (Levada note; media summaries of the “record” highs.) ([Levada Center][7])

My frame remains: **no sudden macro “collapse,” but a tightening sustainment vise**—fuel, finance, labor, and imports—accelerated by Ukrainian deep strikes and smarter enforcement.

## Claim-by-claim: receipts, friction, verdicts

### A) “Capital controls removed the run risk.”

**Steelman:** Correct. Controls + ad hoc decrees stopped a 2022-style RUB spiral and gave fiscal/FX time to breathe. ([Reuters][2])
**Friction:** That tool bought time **by taxing the private economy**: higher borrowing costs, weaker investment, dual-rate distortions. Russia still must import precision goods; sanctions raise prices/latency, and *physical* interdictions now layer on top. (EU/UK tightening on shadow fleet & energy; Reuters.) ([Reuters][8])
**Verdict:** **True but incomplete.** Controls avert classic BOP crises; they don’t fix **import chokepoints** or **repair bombed assets**.

### B) “Low debt = no debt crisis.”

**Steelman:** Russia’s public debt/GDP is low by global standards; the state can lean on captive banks.
**Friction:** When your policy rate hovers in the high teens and OFZ auctions clear near mid-teens, **servicing costs spike**—even on low debt. Moscow is now hiking VAT to 22% and widening 2025’s deficit to ~2.6%/GDP to keep up. (Reuters; Interfax.) ([Reuters][6])
**Verdict:** **Directionally right, dynamically brittle.** The burden is shifting from balance sheet to **cash flow**: high-rate carry, higher taxes, slower growth.

### C) “War spend/GDP shows Russia has headroom.”

**Steelman:** On apples-to-apples, the chart is **roughly right**:

* Russia ~**6–7%** of GDP in 2025 (budget “national defence”), ([Reuters][4])
* U.S. Vietnam peak ~**9%** (OMB tables), ([The White House][9])
* Late-USSR **~15–20%** (CIA est.), ([CIA][10])
* Nazi Germany **~60%** by 1943 (Harrison/Overy). ([University of Warwick][11])
  **Friction:** That metric **misses today’s home-front attrition**. Vietnam-era U.S. and 1980s USSR didn’t have drones torching refineries, export terminals, and gas plants hundreds–thousands of km from the front—Russia does, repeatedly. (Reuters graphic & Kirishi/Orenburg strikes.) ([Reuters][12])
  **Verdict:** **Technically sound, operationally misleading.** The same %-of-GDP buys **less** when part of that GDP is being blown up or rerouted at a discount.

### D) “Imports won’t be suddenly strangled.”

**Steelman:** Food and basic energy, agreed; China/India will keep trading.
**Friction:** The fight is in **high-value inputs** (chips, optics, machine tools) and **shipping insurance/tonnage**. New UK/EU listings target the “shadow fleet” plumbing and raise costs/delay for every marginal barrel/part. (Reuters/EU packages.) ([Reuters][13])
**Verdict:** **Volumes persist, costs creep up.** “No blockade” ≠ “no squeeze.”

### E) “Public can absorb the pain; polling says they’re fine.”

**Steelman:** Life-satisfaction/happiness indicators have printed records since 2023–25. ([IntelliNews][14])
**Friction:** Under wartime authoritarianism, *who answers and how* changes the data. Levada itself has written about **measurement problems and self-censorship**; refusal rates and preference-falsification rise as repression rises. (Levada methodology note.) ([Levada Center][7])
**Verdict:** **Treat as a *controlled* signal, not ground truth.** The same “lens of war” that lifts GDP also **gags criticism**.

### F) “Phase Two tools (price/wage controls) remain unused.”

**Steelman:** True that the Kremlin still has levers.
**Friction:** Using them **admits the squeeze** and worsens distortions: price caps beget shortages, rationing, and black markets—*and* they don’t rebuild a CDU unit at Kirishi. (Price-control deliberations; Kirishi outage.) ([The Moscow Times][3])
**Verdict:** **It’s an option—at a cost.** The more Moscow “manages,” the more productive capacity it sacrifices.

## Does the counter-analysis change our thesis?

**It sharpens it.** The video is right that we shouldn’t sit around predicting a textbook *macro* collapse. Russia still has levers: capital controls, captive finance, taxation, and social coercion. But those levers are now countering **real, compounding losses**:

* **Fuel system degradation** from persistent Ukrainian strikes (≥10 refineries and terminals hit since Aug; one-month Kirishi partial shutdown; new gas-processing disruptions). ([Reuters][5])
* **Budget math flipping** to consumers and future taxpayers (VAT 22%; wider 2025 deficit; liquid NWF ≈ ₽4.17T and trending down). ([Reuters][6])
* **Export workarounds getting pricier/riskier** (shadow-fleet enforcement; Novorossiisk capacity/weather risk). ([Reuters][13])
* **Opinion data with caveats** (record “happiness” alongside admitted survey constraints). ([Levada Center][7])

**My verdict:** the Money & Macro piece is the **best** version of the “Russia won’t just collapse” argument—and it’s largely right on first-order macro logic. Where it doesn’t land is the *operational* reality of a belligerent whose **industrial base is now a battlefield**. That’s the difference-maker between “sustainable churn” and “sustainment break.” Our window (late-2025 to mid-2026) stands, with higher confidence when refinery/port/gas-plant attrition persists and financing tightens. (Refinery strikes series; VAT/deficit/NWF prints.) ([Reuters][12])

## What to watch (one-week tests)

* **Throughput, not headlines:** Does **Kirishi** meaningfully restart its CDU-6 and do **Orenburg/Novokuibyshevsk** resume normal operations—or do export bans/rationing signals linger? ([Reuters][15])
* **Shipping friction:** Any **detentions/insurance refusals/STS delays** tied to new sanctions listings or weather at **Novorossiisk**? ([Reuters][13])
* **OFZ pain:** Back-to-back auctions printing **≥15%** would move our financing tripwire toward ON. (High-rate backdrop in recent months; Reuters.) ([Reuters][16])
* **Buffers:** Fresh **NWF (liquid)** disclosures drifting toward **₽2–3T** would mark a real cushion breach. ([Interfax][17])
* **AD magazines vs. strikes:** Whether Ukraine sustains the **deep-strike tempo** and whether Western air-defense resupply schemes (Patriot munitions via pooled buys) visibly bite. ([Reuters][12])
