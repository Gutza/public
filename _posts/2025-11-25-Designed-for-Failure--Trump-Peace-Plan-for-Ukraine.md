description: "Trump’s 28-point peace plan for Ukraine is being sold as diplomacy slowly converging on compromise, even though the Kremlin has already rejected its most Russia-friendly version. This piece dissects why it remains structurally incompatible with both Ukraine’s survival and Europe’s security even after further modifications, and argues that these “off-ramps for Putin” are designed for Trump’s domestic narrative and alliance management rather than for actually ending the war."

# Designed for Failure: Trump's Peace Plan for Ukraine
_Exploring an apparent diplomatic contradiction: why are we still talking about watering down Trump's proposed 28-point peace plan that was rejected by Moscow even in its original form?_

When I published my [November update](https://medium.com/@gutzas/when-will-russia-fall-november-update-8da4e7216d50), a reader asked a [deceptively simple question](https://medium.com/@ysb645/one-question-if-things-are-so-bad-for-russia-why-doesnt-putin-take-one-of-the-many-suger-coated-3bf1b8e1abff):

> If things are so bad for Russia, why doesn’t Putin just take one of the many sugar-coated off-ramps Trump keeps offering him? -Michael

A week later, we’re drowning in headlines that *seem* to suggest that's exactly what's finally happening. The outlines of a [28-point U.S. peace proposal](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/draft-us-backed-peace-proposal-ukraine-2025-11-21/) leak. Reports say Ukraine is being pressed to accept a deal that would [give up land and some weapons](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-proposals-end-russias-war-involve-ukraine-giving-up-land-some-weapons-sources-2025-11-19/). European governments push back and produce their own [counter-proposal](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/full-text-european-counter-proposal-us-ukraine-peace-plan-2025-11-23/). Washington and Kyiv then announce an “[updated and refined peace framework](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-ukraine-european-officials-hold-talks-geneva-trumps-plan-end-war-2025-11-23/)” cut down to 19 points. Geneva talks, Abu Dhabi talks, “constructive dialogue”, cautious optimism.

If you consume this one news cycle at a time, it looks like a process that is slowly converging on peace: a maximalist initial draft, European corrections, Ukrainian input, U.S. flexibility, quiet contact with Moscow. The impression is of *movement* – that if we just keep tweaking clauses and commas, we’ll eventually arrive at a text everyone can sign.

The reality is almost the opposite. The Kremlin keeps saying it has seen no “official” plan worth reacting to and that there are “no innovations” in Russia’s position; when asked about the European edits, it simply states that the new version “does not work for Russia”. Kyiv publicly doubts Moscow’s desire for peace, and even after the 28 points are cut down to 19, the most sensitive decisions are explicitly parked for Trump and Putin to hash out directly – in other words, for the two people whose incentives are most misaligned with a stable settlement.

This piece argues that what we’re watching is not a negotiation that hasn’t yet found the right compromise. It is **an exercise in redesigning the wrapping for something that cannot, by construction, be made acceptable to all three key actors**. It’s not that the West hasn’t yet found the magic offer; it’s that Putin’s real demands are structurally incompatible with any survivable deal for Ukraine and for Europe’s security architecture.

The goal here is to step back from the daily noise and treat Trump’s peace plan as an object of analysis rather than faith. We’ll look at what the 28 points actually contain, how they morphed into 19, and why every iteration is dead on arrival in Moscow – even before you ask whether Kyiv or Brussels could ever sign it. Only then does Michael’s question really make sense: not “why won’t Putin take the off-ramp?”, but **who exactly are these off-ramps built for?**

# What Trump’s Peace Plan Actually Is (and Isn’t)

Before we can say anything useful about the diplomacy, we need to pin down what “Trump’s peace plan” actually is. That’s not entirely trivial, because we are dealing with leaks, reconstructions and partial texts. But taken together, the [Reuters draft](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/draft-us-backed-peace-proposal-ukraine-2025-11-21/), European counter-proposals, and media analyses give us a fairly coherent picture.

In outline, the story looks like this:

* A 28-point plan is crafted largely outside normal diplomatic channels, reportedly over [dinners in Miami](https://nypost.com/2025/11/24/us-news/initial-ukraine-russia-peace-plan-was-hashed-out-over-dinners-in-miami-report/) between Trump allies and a Putin-linked financier.
* The plan is presented to Kyiv and leaked, prompting immediate concern in Ukraine and Europe that it reads like a [“Kremlin wish-list”](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/ukraine-doubts-russias-desire-for-peace-amid-reports-of-us-drafted-plan).
* Under pressure, Washington, Kyiv and key European capitals work on modifications that strip out the most blatant concessions and reduce the document to 19 points – a process the U.S. and Ukraine now market as an “[updated and refined](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-ukraine-european-officials-hold-talks-geneva-trumps-plan-end-war-2025-11-23/)” framework.
* Throughout, the Kremlin maintains a studied distance, insisting there are contacts but no negotiations and that neither the original American version nor the [European edits](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-european-counter-proposal-ukraine-peace-does-not-work-russia-2025-11-24/) are acceptable.

So what’s *in* this famous 28-point text, and why did so many observers immediately read it as structurally pro-Moscow?

## The 28-Point Plan in One Page

Different outlets emphasise different aspects, but the core elements of the 28-point plan show up again and again in the [Reuters draft text](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/draft-us-backed-peace-proposal-ukraine-2025-11-21/), in European summaries, and in explainer pieces like the one from the [ABC](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-25/what-we-know-about-the-28-point-plan-for-peace/106046140).

Very roughly, the 28 points do the following:

* **Territory.** De facto recognition of Russian control over Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk, with Kherson and Zaporizhzhia frozen along current contact lines and a demilitarised buffer zone in parts of Donbas. This consolidates the [land bridge from Russia to Crimea](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61504810) and locks in year-round access to the Black Sea for Russia under much softer sanctions.
* **Neutralisation of Ukraine.** Ukraine would receive “security guarantees” but be constitutionally barred from joining NATO, with a ban on permanent NATO troop deployments in the country and strict caps on the size and posture of its armed forces. Multiple reports highlight forced reductions in Ukraine’s army and long-range strike capabilities.
* **Western guarantees to Russia.** A broader non-aggression framework involving Russia, Ukraine and NATO, and an effective veto on future NATO expansion eastwards, echoing long-standing Russian demands for a “sphere of influence”.
* **Economic reintegration.** Russia is promised a phased path back into the global economy and even potential [return to the G8](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/draft-us-backed-peace-proposal-ukraine-2025-11-21/), while frozen Russian assets would fund both Ukrainian reconstruction and joint U.S.–Russian ventures.
* **Governance and oversight.** Implementation would be overseen by a “Board of Peace” chaired personally by Trump, giving him permanent ownership of the settlement architecture.

If you read that list with a map in front of you, the tilt becomes obvious. In concrete geostrategic terms, the plan:

* Locks in Russia’s land bridge and year-round, sanctions-softened access to the Black Sea.
* Removes Ukraine from NATO’s enlargement map and caps its military for the foreseeable future.
* Offers Moscow a realistic route back into Western finance and institutions.

From a Ukrainian or European perspective, this is why commentators and officials talk about a “[Kremlin wish-list](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/ukraine-doubts-russias-desire-for-peace-amid-reports-of-us-drafted-plan)” or a plan that “largely reflects Russian demands”. European ministers have been unusually blunt that peace cannot mean “capitulation” and that they will not sign up to a settlement that rewards aggression with territory and long-term military advantage.

And yet, in this context, the most striking fact is that **even this plan is not good enough for Moscow**. Officially, the Kremlin says it has seen no detailed proposal and that media reports are “not a basis for serious comment”. Unofficially, when asked about the emerging European edits, it states plainly that the counter-proposal “does not work for Russia” – diplomatic code for “this is nowhere near what we want”.

The refusal to even *engage* on terms so heavily tilted in Russia's favour is what sets up the central contradiction of the whole exercise.

## From 28 to 19 Points – The Cosmetic Diet

Once the 28-point text leaked and the backlash landed, the global diplomatic machinery went into damage-control mode.

European leaders made it clear, on and off the record, that forcing Kyiv to accept permanent territorial losses and deep cuts to its military was a non-starter. French officials warned that “peace cannot mean capitulation”, and German diplomats fretted about the signal it would send to other revisionist powers watching from the sidelines.

In response:

* Britain, France and Germany drafted a detailed [point-by-point counter-proposal](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/full-text-european-counter-proposal-us-ukraine-peace-plan-2025-11-23/) that keeps the U.S. plan as a base but deletes or rewrites some of the most egregious provisions.
* U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators met in Geneva and announced that they had produced an “[updated and refined peace framework](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-ukraine-european-officials-hold-talks-geneva-trumps-plan-end-war-2025-11-23/)” cut down from 28 to 19 points, with the most controversial issues kicked upstairs to Trump and Zelensky (and, eventually, Putin).
* Ukrainian media like the [Kyiv Independent](https://kyivindependent.com/trump-quite-pleased-with-ukraine-peace-talks-as-europe-reportedly-issues-counterproposal/) and European outlets such as [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/11/25/relief-and-uncertainty-for-ukraine-and-europe-after-trump-s-plan-undergoes-major-overhaul_6747807_4.html) report that the 19-point version removes explicit caps on Ukraine’s army and softens language on NATO, while keeping enough of the original structure for Trump to claim continuity.

As a result, the “cosmetic diet” from 28 to 19 points is not about luring Russia back to the table. It is about:

* Ton­ing down territorial concessions beyond current front lines.
* Stripping out clauses that would openly cripple Ukraine’s defence.
* Rewriting the worst optics for European capitals that would otherwise have to sign this in front of their own voters.

Everyone involved is quite open about this. U.S. officials call the document a “living, breathing” framework that needs to reflect “realistic compromises from both parties”, while European diplomats brief that their edits aim to “rebalance” a plan that started out far too close to Moscow’s preferences.

And that leads directly to the contradiction we’ll unpack below: if the 28-point version already looked like a Russian wish-list and still wasn’t acceptable to the Kremlin, **what exactly is the point of watering it down for Kyiv and Brussels?**

## Who Each Version Is Really For

Once you strip away the marketing, each iteration of the plan has a different primary audience.

* The **28-point version** is crafted to give Trump a “historic peace” narrative and to lock in, on paper, many of the gains Russia has been fighting for since 2014: entrenched control over Crimea and much of Donbas, a neutralised Ukraine, and a path back into the Western economic system. The fact it was hashed out in semi-private between Trump envoys and a Putin-linked financier, with Kyiv largely sidelined, tells you all you need to know about whose interests were front-loaded.
* The **19-point “refined framework”** is designed to keep the West from splitting over that fact. Its core political function is to give Washington, Kyiv and major European capitals a joint storyline: *we listened, we made changes, this is no longer a capitulation, and we’re still trying diplomacy*. It doesn’t suddenly start addressing Putin’s regime-survival constraints; it just makes the text slightly less radioactive for Ukraine and the EU.

What neither version does is engage seriously with the underlying logic in Moscow. That is the gap the rest of this article tries to fill – by analyzing Trump’s “peace plan” not as a mysterious diplomatic breakthrough, but as what it actually is: a document optimized for U.S. domestic politics and Western alliance management, colliding head-on with Putin’s much narrower and far more brutal notion of what an acceptable endgame looks like.

# Three Incompatible Logics: Washington, Kyiv, Moscow

If you try to make sense of the current “peace” debate as a standard negotiation, you end up confused very quickly. The problem isn’t that the players are irrational in some abstract sense; it’s that they’re rational *inside completely different games*. Put those logics on a Venn diagram and the overlap is effectively zero.

## The Trump Logic: I Need a Story

Trump’s side of this is the easiest to understand, because it is almost entirely domestic.

During the campaign and well into his presidency he repeatedly claimed he could end the war in “24 hours” or “on Day One”, only to later admit that this was “a little bit sarcastic” and walk the promise back into a vague six-month horizon.  What matters for him is not a *stable European security architecture* but a **narrative for U.S. voters**:

* “I stopped the war on Day One.”
* “I made those freeloading Europeans pay.”
* “I forced Kyiv and Moscow to do a deal nobody else could.”

That’s the target function. Everything else is noise. And a 28-point peace plan serves this story very well:

* On paper it looks detailed and “presidential”, even if large parts are unworkable.
* The draft published by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/draft-us-backed-peace-proposal-ukraine-2025-11-21/) reads like a menu of Russian preferences – territorial concessions in Crimea and Donbas, caps on Ukraine’s armed forces, and a path back into the G8 – so if Moscow refuses he can say: *we tried, it’s their fault*.
* If Kyiv refuses, he can flip the script and tell U.S. voters they are “ungrateful” and “don’t want peace”, as several of his allies have already hinted in public hearings and briefings.

Notice what is missing from this logic: any real concern for **deterrence in the Black Sea**, for [NATO’s eastern flank](https://www.nato.int/en/what-we-do/deterrence-and-defence/strengthening-natos-eastern-flank), or for the precedent of rewarding a war of conquest against a neighbour whose territorial integrity is explicitly guaranteed by the [U.N. Charter](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter) and multiple bilateral agreements. The costs of a bad deal are largely externalized onto Ukraine and Europe, while the **benefits of a photo-op peace** are internalized in U.S. domestic politics.

That’s why Trump’s plans end up looking like sugar-coated offers to Moscow: they are designed to be easy for him to sell as “reasonable”, not to solve Russia’s long-term regime problem (never mind America’s European allies).

## The Ukrainian Logic: Survival as a State

For Kyiv, the logic is brutally simple: any deal has to preserve **Ukraine as a sovereign, defensible state with a path to the West**. That means, at minimum:

* A coherent territorial core (not a mutilated, landlocked remainder).
* Real, enforceable security guarantees – not just paper promises.
* A serious army with air defence and long-range strike capability.
* Continued integration with the EU and [NATO structures](https://www.nato.int/en/what-we-do/partnerships-and-cooperation/relations-with-ukraine), formal or informal.

Strip any of these away and you don’t get “peace”; you get a slow-motion defeat.

And Ukrainians have a long memory. When they look at a “crippled Ukraine” scenario, they don’t imagine a boring, status-quo neighbour. They remember:

* The [Holodomor](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine/The-famine-of-1932-33-Holodomor), the man-made famine of 1932–33 engineered by Stalin that killed millions.
* The [Budapest Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum) of 1994, notably signed by Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom, which promised Ukraine security in exchange for nuclear disarmament and then failed spectacularly in 2014.
* The [illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014](https://www.ibanet.org/Ukraine-clear-breaches-of-international-law-in-Crimea), carried out under military occupation and denounced as a breach of international law by Western governments and legal scholars alike.
* February 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion designed as a [decapitation strike on Kyiv](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-believes-russia-planning-decapitate-ukraines-government-2022-02-24/).
* Systematic war crimes documented in [Bucha](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/marking-third-anniversary-liberation-bucha-ukraine_en) and elsewhere, with independent investigations by [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/04/ukraine-apparent-war-crimes-by-russian-forces-in-bucha-must-be-investigated/) and other bodies.
* The [destruction of Mariupol](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/02/08/ukraine-new-findings-russias-devastation-mariupol) and estimates of more than [8,000 people killed during the siege](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/more-than-8000-killed-during-2022-mariupol-siege-human-rights-watch-2024-02-08/).
* The [mass graves uncovered in Izium](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/ukraine-mass-graves-in-izium-is-a-macabre-reminder-of-the-cost-of-russian-aggression/) after Russian occupation.
* The [abduction and forced transfer of Ukrainian children](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/it/document/EPRS_BRI%282023%29747093), which is precisely why the ICC warrant exists in the first place and why Kyiv keeps taking new evidence to The Hague.

From that perspective, a disarmed, partitioned Ukraine next to a resentful, unreformed Russia is not “peace”. It is a holding pattern before the next invasion.

So when Trump’s plan demands that Ukraine gives up more land, accepts limits on its army, and delays or abandons NATO integration, Kyiv doesn’t see an imperfect but acceptable compromise. It sees a blueprint for **future catastrophe** with fewer tools to resist it – essentially a replay of [Budapest-style guarantees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances) that failed once already, only with more Russian troops parked closer to Odesa and Mykolaiv.

## The Putin Logic: Regime Survival and Imperial Mission

Putin’s logic sits in a different universe again. For him this war is no longer about Donetsk or Crimea; it is about *personal survival and historical mission*. Several hard constraints shape his choices:

* **No safe exit.** There is an [ICC arrest warrant](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-and) with his name on it for the deportation of children, one of the rare cases where a sitting permanent-member head of state has been personally indicted. Even if he never sets foot in The Hague, it narrows his international options and raises the personal stakes. And even if he spends the rest of his life in Russia, leaving power as “the man who lost to Ukraine” is an excellent way to end up dead or in a cell – which in Russia is often the same thing, just slower.
* **Constitutional annexations.** He didn’t just occupy some territory; he already rewrote the Russian constitution back in 2022 to declare those regions forever part of Russia. Returning “Russian land” to Ukraine is not a policy adjustment, it’s a [direct attack](https://cepa.org/article/how-russias-new-constitution-hinders-peace-in-ukraine/) on the myth of the infallible leader and the sacredness of Russian borders.
* **The autocrat’s dilemma.** Democratic leaders can lose wars and retire to write memoirs. Dictators usually can’t. For Putin, “we launched a historic war and then backed down with nothing to show for it” isn’t a bad poll number, it is regime suicide. The literature on the [Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan](https://www.britannica.com/event/Soviet-invasion-of-Afghanistan) and its role in destabilising the USSR gives a good sense of why defeat in a costly, ideologised war terrifies autocrats.
* **Asymmetric pain.** When we say “Russia is suffering”, we implicitly imagine that the Kremlin feels that pain evenly. It doesn’t. Studies of casualty data show that poorer, peripheral regions and non-Russian ethnic minorities such as [Buryats and Tuvans](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol48/31/48-31.pdf) are far more likely to die in Ukraine than men from Moscow or St Petersburg. Reporting on [indigenous communities like Buryatia](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/russias-indigenous-communities-and-war-ukraine) paints the same picture. As long as the core regime coalition in the big cities remains shielded, the war can be “bad for Russia” while still feeling *manageable* in the Kremlin.
* **The information bubble.** After years of purges, loyalty tests and media control, documented in detail by [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-crackdown-independent-media-and-access-information-online) and [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/report/2025/07/30/disrupted-throttled-and-blocked/state-censorship-control-and-increasing-isolation), Putin no longer lives in a world of accurate data. He lives in a curated reality in which Russian industry is surging, sanctions are a nuisance, and Western democracies are always one election away from collapse. In that world, time is on his side and any demand for compromise looks suspiciously like a Western trap.

Put these together and you get a simple conclusion: **any deal short of total victory over Ukraine looks to Putin like a less controllable form of defeat** than continuing the war. A Trump-branded peace that formalises Russian gains but leaves a Western-armed Ukraine in place is still a future threat – and it doesn’t solve his personal exit problem. Better to wait, escalate, and hope the coalition against him cracks.

# Why Trump’s Off-Ramps Don’t Look Like Exits to Putin

Once you see how misaligned these three logics are, the “mystery” of Moscow rejecting a very generous 28-point plan largely evaporates. From Putin’s point of view, Trump isn’t offering him a luxurious off-ramp. He’s offering him **several different ways to crash the car**.

## The Set of Acceptable Deals for Putin Is Tiny

If we strip away the rhetoric and look at what Putin would actually need from a settlement, the list is short and brutal:

* Formal or de facto **recognition of all annexed territories** as Russian.
* A Ukraine that is **militarily weak**, ideally demilitarised in the south and east.
* **No meaningful Western security guarantees** for Kyiv – certainly nothing NATO-like.
* **Substantial sanctions relief** and re-access to Western finance and technology.
* A narrative he can sell at home as a **victory or at least a draw**, not an admission of failure.

Trump’s original 28-point plan moves quite far in that direction: the [Reuters draft](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/draft-us-backed-peace-proposal-ukraine-2025-11-21/) recognises Russian control of Crimea and most of the Donbas, caps Ukraine’s army and missile forces, and envisages a staged return of Russia to the global economy and even to the G8. Even Trump’s own Secretary of State-designate has reportedly called it more of a Russian “wish-list” than an American proposal.

And yet Moscow still brushes it aside. Why? Because even this tilted framework **fails on the regime-survival axis**. It leaves Ukraine existing as a separate state with Western backing and a non-trivial military. It bakes in a precedent that aggression can be at least partially reversed and constrained. It does nothing about the ICC warrant or the internal elite dynamics that would judge Putin harshly for accepting less than maximal war aims.

From the outside, the set of “deals that should be acceptable to Russia” looks wide. From inside Putin’s bunker, the truly acceptable set may be empty or close to it.

## The Intersection with Ukrainian/Western Red Lines Is Basically Empty

Now flip the problem around and ask: what is the minimum that Ukraine and its partners can live with?

* Ukraine needs to keep enough territory, population and infrastructure to remain a viable state.
* It needs credible guarantees that it won’t face the same invasion again in five or ten years – something stronger than the [Budapest Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances), which promised security in exchange for nuclear disarmament and then failed spectacularly in 2014.
* Europe needs to avoid setting a precedent that **nuclear-armed revisionist states can carve up neighbours and get rewarded for it**, especially with a land bridge to the Black Sea and a long-term military foothold there that would undermine NATO’s entire [eastern-flank deterrence posture](https://www.csis.org/analysis/deterrence-natos-eastern-flank).

Those are not moral luxuries, they are hard security requirements. A plan that leaves Russia entrenched on the Black Sea coast and Ukraine disarmed is a strategic defeat for Europe for decades to come; you can find that concern spelled out explicitly in European statements on Crimea and the Black Sea after 2014.

If you overlay those minimum requirements with Putin’s minimum requirements, you don’t get a narrow overlap you can bargain over. You get **two separate islands**.

That’s why the move from 28 to 19 points doesn’t “inch us closer to peace”. The revisions that make the plan slightly less suicidal for Ukraine – fewer territorial giveaways, weaker restrictions on the Ukrainian army, stronger language on security guarantees, as described in the [Guardian’s coverage of the “updated framework”](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/23/trump-ukraine-zero-gratitude-peace-plan-international-talks) – are precisely the changes that make it *less* attractive to Putin. *Each adjustment that makes the plan more realistic for Kyiv and Brussels pushes it further away from the already tiny set of outcomes the Kremlin might consider.*

## Why “Better Now Than Later” Doesn’t Apply to Autocrats

At this point, someone always asks: *“But surely even Putin can see that things are getting worse; shouldn’t he lock in a favourable deal now rather than risk getting less later?”* That logic works reasonably well in democracies and in business negotiations. It breaks down in autocracies for two main reasons.

1. **The downside of compromise is existential.**
   In a normal negotiation, walking away with 60% instead of 80% is disappointing but survivable. In Putin’s case, taking a visibly compromised deal could trigger elite backlash, popular disillusionment, or simply the erosion of the fear that keeps the system together. The downside isn’t “20 percentage points of value lost”; it’s “you might not be alive in five years”. Autocrats in similar positions – from late-war Germany to the final years of the [Soviet occupation of Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_withdrawal_from_Afghanistan) – routinely chose to prolong unwinnable conflicts rather than sign their own political death warrants.

2. **The upside of waiting is fantasised, not calculated.**
   Because his information flow is distorted, Putin can always convince himself that something will turn up:

   * Western unity will fracture after the next election.
   * Sanctions will erode.
   * A new crisis (Taiwan, the Middle East) will distract NATO.
   * Ukraine will run out of men, ammo or political cohesion.

   In an information bubble where Russia is supposedly re-industrialising and Western democracies are on the verge of collapse, these are not wild hopes; they are the *expected* future.

As long as he can sustain that belief, **waiting dominates** signing a document that locks in anything less than victory. Even if the war is slowly grinding Russia down, that pain is abstract; the risk of a humiliating deal feels immediate and personal.

History is full of leaders who rode this logic all the way off the cliff. Hitler in 1943–44 showed no interest in serious negotiations even after Stalingrad and Kursk had already made ultimate defeat almost certain; German “peace feelers” went nowhere because the regime wouldn’t put its own survival on the table.  Soviet leaders kept pouring resources into Afghanistan until Gorbachev finally overruled the system and accepted withdrawal, by which point the war had already helped destabilise the USSR itself.

Putin is operating in the same mental space. From our vantage point, taking a generous Trump plan now looks like cutting his losses. From his vantage point, it looks like voluntarily jumping into the abyss, when there is still a non-zero chance that someone else falls first. Put together, this is why Trump’s off-ramps are designed for failure – not necessarily because Trump desires them to fail, it’s just that the design itself is not primarily motivated by the desire to succeed.

# The “Painting” Metaphor: When Bargaining Theory Breaks

At first glance (or if you look at it piecemeal, only glancing at individual 24-hour increments), the whole Trump–Putin–Zelensky triangle looks like a classic bargaining problem. In standard international-relations theory, wars are treated as what James Fearon famously called a [“bargaining failure”](https://web.stanford.edu/group/fearon-research/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Rationalist-Explanations-for-War.pdf): because war is costly for everyone, there *should* exist some deal that both sides prefer to continued fighting.

Think of a painting you want to buy:

* You (Washington) offer to pay €100.
* The seller (Moscow) rejects the offer.
* You start negotiating (Berlin, Kyiv, London, Paris, Washington).

Trump’s diplomacy is sold to the public as exactly that kind of process: we start with a maximalist 28-point list, then “move towards the middle” – cut it to 19 points, tweak wording on NATO, adjust the buffer zones, find a clever formula for sanctions and frozen assets, and so on.

Except that the West's next offer is €75, not €120.

## Putin’s Reservation Price Is Not a Price, It’s an Outcome

Putin’s side does not see this as haggling over a painting. It sees it as deciding whether the gallery is open at all – and whether its director might end up in handcuffs.

If you translate his real demands into bargaining terms, they look less like a “share of the pie” and more like a **binary outcome**:

* A Ukraine that is defeated, controlled or permanently vulnerable.
* A Russia that is recognised as having redrawn the map by force.
* A domestic narrative in which Putin emerges as the restorer of empire, not the man who lost a war to a smaller neighbour.

Those are not marginal adjustments on a negotiable spectrum. They are *indivisible* outcomes in exactly the sense bargaining theorists worry about: you either have a genuinely subordinate Ukraine or you don’t. You either come home as the victor or you don’t.

Given the structural mismatch, *any* text that is signable for Kyiv and Europe will not be signable for Putin, and vice versa. The negotiator's textbook “zone of possible agreement” isn’t just narrow – it is, for all practical purposes, void.

Which is why the “painting” metaphor matters: once you understand that one side is pricing a canvas and the other is pricing the destruction of an entire gallery, the obsession with getting the wording of the 19 points “just right” starts to look less like negotiation and more like theatre.

# The Illusion of Progress: Why Diplomats Keep Producing Paper

If the plan is structurally unworkable, why are we still watching new drafts roll out of Geneva, Brussels and Washington every few days? Why is there always another communique about “progress”, “momentum”, and “constructive engagement”?

Because in the real world, diplomacy is not only about solving the conflict. It is also about **managing alliances, shifting blame and preserving institutions**. On those fronts, producing paper is a feature, not a bug.

## Domestic Politics and Blame-Shifting

For Trump, the political logic is straightforward: he needs to be able to say, in 2026 and 2028, that he offered a “reasonable peace” and that it was **rejected** – by Kyiv, by European “globalists”, or by Putin, depending on the audience.

The 28-point plan is perfect for this:

* If Ukraine says no, he can argue that they “don’t want peace” and that U.S. taxpayers shouldn’t keep funding them. His allies have already framed the plan as a “last chance” before support is cut.
* If Putin publicly complains that the European-edited version “does not work for Russia”, Trump can point back to the original U.S. text and say: *we had a deal, but Europe sabotaged it*.

In both cases, the existence of a document – *any* document – is more important than its viability. The very fact that there is a numbered list, a PDF, a “framework” gives the White House something to wave in front of cameras when handing out blame.

European leaders play the same game, from the opposite side. When they publish their own [28-point counter-proposal](https://news.sky.com/story/in-full-europes-28-point-counter-proposal-to-us-russia-peace-plan-for-ukraine-13474575) and talk about a “rebalanced” framework, they are not necessarily convinced that Putin will ever sign it. They are ensuring that if things go wrong, they can say to their own voters:

* We pushed back against the worst elements.
* We demanded respect for Ukrainian sovereignty.
* We didn’t just accept a diktat scripted in Miami and Mar-a-Lago.

The paper trail is, in that sense, a shield.

## Institutional Reflex: Process as a Product

There is also a deep institutional reflex at work. As UN and academic handbooks on mediation politely put it, **peace processes have their own momentum**: once you start a track of talks, envoys, joint statements and draft texts, not having anything to show at the next conference becomes politically embarrassing.

So the system keeps generating something:

* A new draft with five points “bracketed” for leaders.
* A communique that “welcomes progress” and “notes remaining differences”.
* A technical working group to study the “sequencing of sanctions relief and territorial issues”.

None of this necessarily moves the underlying geometry. But it prevents the process from being declared dead, which itself has costs: declaring talks dead is seen as “escalatory”, makes leaders look inflexible, and can trigger market and security jitters.

In other words, the **process becomes a product**. Its purpose is to reassure allies, signal “responsible behaviour” to undecided states, and shield decision-makers from accusations that they didn’t even “try diplomacy”.

## How Media Coverage Amplifies the Mirage

Finally, the media ecology makes it very hard to see the stuck geometry behind the motion.

Each micro-step – Miami dinners, leaks, counter-drafts, Geneva meetings, Putin’s latest comment about the plan being a “basis for peace” – becomes its own story. Live blogs from outlets like the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/nov/24/ukraine-russia-war-peace-talks-europe-us-trump-germany-latest-updates) or [Sky News](https://news.sky.com/story/trumps-28-point-ukraine-peace-plan-in-full-including-land-kyiv-must-hand-to-russia-and-when-elections-must-be-held-13473491) quite reasonably track and package each development as “new momentum” or “fresh tensions”.

What gets lost is the continuity: that, structurally, we are circling the same dead end. Without that context, the public is left with the impression of a slowly advancing peace process – when in fact we’re watching three different actors use the same pile of paper for three completely different purposes.

# What Would Actually Have to Change for a Real Deal

If Trump’s plan and its offspring are structurally misaligned with Putin’s incentives and Ukraine’s survival, what *would* have to change for a negotiated settlement to become realistic?

The point here is not to predict the future, but to map the kinds of shifts that the war-termination literature says actually matter – the sorts of changes that Allan Stam and Dan Reiter talk about in *[How Wars End](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691140605/how-wars-end)* or that bargaining theorists highlight when they discuss credible commitments and changing power balances.

Three broad families of scenarios stand out.

## 1. Internal Change in Russia

The most obvious, and least controllable, is **regime change** – not necessarily a democratic revolution, but any transition that breaks the personal linkage between “Putin, the war, and the state”.

A post-Putin leadership that:

* Faces the same sanctions and battlefield realities.
* But does *not* carry the same personal ICC liability and mythological baggage.

might find it easier to accept what political scientists call a “[costly signal](https://svmiller.com/blog/2021/09/rationalist-explanations-war/)” of defeat: giving up territory, accepting non-aggression clauses, or limiting offensive capabilities in ways that the current Kremlin cannot.

There is no guarantee that such a regime would be more benign – it could just as easily be more hardline – but the *structure* of the bargaining problem would change, because the personal survival of one man would no longer be so tightly fused with the war’s outcome.

## 2. A Battlefield Collapse So Severe It Flips the Survival Logic

A second family of scenarios involves a **military collapse** so stark that continuing the war becomes more dangerous to the regime than cutting a bad deal.

Historically, that’s what forced the hand of leaders like Kaiser Wilhelm in 1918 and, in a different way, the Soviet leadership in [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_withdrawal_from_Afghanistan): the combination of battlefield losses, economic crisis and domestic unrest made “staying in” more threatening to regime survival than “getting out”.

In theory, something similar *could* happen to Russia:

* A string of major defeats that threatens key cities or the land bridge.
* Simultaneous shocks in energy revenues and the budget that undermine the payments to the security apparatus.
* Visible cracks in the elite coalition – public defiance from governors, oligarchs or security chiefs.

At that point, the regime’s internal calculation could flip, making a painful negotiated exit the *less* risky option. But that’s a very different dynamic from “let’s sign Trump’s plan because it’s generous”. It would be closer to a controlled retreat to avoid a worse internal catastrophe.

## 3. A Security Architecture That Actually Solves the Commitment Problem

A third – and more optimistic – family of scenarios involves building a **wider security architecture** that addresses at least some of Russia’s stated concerns *without* sacrificing Ukrainian sovereignty.

In theory, you could imagine:

* A heavily armed, NATO-integrated Ukraine, but with strict limits on offensive deployments near Russia’s borders.
* A mutual non-aggression pact backed by intrusive verification and serious penalties for violations.
* A layered system of [arms control and confidence-building measures](https://www.osce.org/confidence-and-security-building-measures) reminiscent of late Cold War Europe, but updated for drones, cyber and long-range missiles.

The problem is not that such architectures are unimaginable – we’ve had versions of them before. The problem is that the current Kremlin rhetoric and practice (“Ukraine is not a real state”, “historical reunification”) are completely incompatible with the kind of **credible commitments** such a system would require.

So yes, in principle, a durable peace could emerge from some mix of regime change, military collapse, and new institutions that solve the commitment problem. But notice how far all of this is from tweaking a 28-point Trump document. The path to real peace runs through **facts on the ground and transformations in power and institutions**, not cleverer wordsmithing.

# What Trump’s 28-Point Plan *Does* Accomplish

For all its structural flaws, Trump’s plan is not completely useless as an artefact. It performs at least two revealing functions.

## It Exposes the Real Stakes

First, by putting in writing what a “Russia-friendly” peace might look like – permanent territorial concessions, a neutralised Ukraine, sanctions relief, and a Russian land bridge to the Black Sea – the plan forces everyone to confront the actual trade-offs.

When even such a document, hailed by Moscow as something that could “[form the basis](https://nypost.com/2025/11/24/world-news/russia-friendly-us-cease-fire-plan-could-pave-the-way-for-peace-in-ukraine-putin-says/)” of peace, proves unacceptable or endlessly mutable in the Kremlin’s hands, it becomes harder to sustain the illusion that there exists some magical “balanced” plan hidden just around the corner.

In that sense, **the 28 points act as a stress test: if *this* doesn’t unlock a genuine negotiation, what will?**

## It Clarifies the Choice for Everyone Else

Second, the debate around the plan clarifies the choice facing Ukraine and Europe. You can see it in the language of EU leaders who now talk openly about **red lines on territory**, about refusing a settlement that would leave Ukraine “defenceless”, and about the need to avoid rewarding aggression.

By turning what used to be implicit into an explicit menu, Trump’s plan forces governments to go on the record:

* Do you accept a Russian land bridge and a permanently weakened Ukraine in exchange for a ceasefire?
* Do you believe Moscow will respect such a deal in the medium term?
* Are you willing to underwrite it with your own security guarantees and budgets?

That clarity is uncomfortable, but useful. It makes it harder for politicians to hide behind vague calls for “peace” that never specify on whose terms.

There is a darker “accomplishment” too, of course: the plan has already created **friction within the Western camp**, with Eastern Europeans, the Baltics and Nordics deeply alarmed, and France/Germany trying to massage the text into something they can live with. From Putin’s perspective, that disarray is a gift.

But at least it brings the underlying question into focus: is the West prepared to trade lasting security for a short-term, Trump-branded ceasefire?

# Recognizing a Dead End When You See One

Michael’s question was simple: _if things are so bad for Russia, why doesn’t Putin just take one of Trump’s many sugar-coated off-ramps?_

The long answer we’ve just walked through boils down to this:

* Trump’s peace plan is **optimised for his narrative**, not for war termination. It gives him a story to tell U.S. voters, not a robust European security order.
* For Ukraine, the original 28-point version looks like a blueprint for slow strangulation: territorial amputations, a capped army, and a veto over its future in NATO.
* For Putin, even that generous text fails the basic test of regime survival. It leaves a Western-armed Ukraine on his border, bakes in the precedent that aggression can be constrained, and does nothing to solve his personal ICC and “lost the war” problems.

Once you put those three logics together, the mystery evaporates. The problem is not that we haven’t yet found the right mix of clauses. The problem is that **any deal acceptable to Ukraine and Europe is existentially unacceptable to Putin – and any deal acceptable to Putin is existentially unacceptable to Ukraine and Europe**.

As long as that remains true, “peace plans” of the Trump type are not pathways to peace. They are:

* instruments in a blame game (who killed the deal?);
* tools for alliance management (who can claim they “softened” it?);
* and props in domestic politics on all sides.

Recognising that does not mean giving up on diplomacy. It means being honest about what diplomacy can and cannot do when faced with an autocrat whose reservation price is not a discount on a painting but the preservation of his own system and myth.

In that world, the most important work is not finding the perfect paragraph for point 17(b). It is shaping the **material, political and institutional conditions** under which a genuinely sustainable settlement becomes thinkable at all – and being clear-eyed that, under Putin, those conditions are still nowhere in sight.
