# Bandcamp: The New Old Way To Experience Music

> ***[Bandcamp](https://www.bandcamp.com/) is an artist-first online music store and community builder with streaming as a secondary service:** you don’t subscribe; you choose what to own.*

In today's online media streaming offering, their concept is refreshingly old-school: it combines the Wild West approach of [Napster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster) and [OiNK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oink%27s_Pink_Palace) (minus piracy) with the rather quaint idea that music fans should connect directly with the artists. The core mechanics of their approach force you to ponder and choose mindfully; it's a completely different experience from the fast food, convenience-first approach of a streaming service. Bandcamp basically forces you to stop and smell the roses.

Bandcamp’s mechanics are straightforward and unusually legible: limited free streams to sample, then pay once to unlock permanent downloads and unlimited app playback. Fees are taken from the seller side, not tacked on to fans. The result is closer to a high-trust record shop than a jukebox.

## What Bandcamp is (and isn’t)

Bandcamp is an **artist-first store** with community features and a built-in player. You buy individual tracks or albums; once purchased, they sit in your collection for streaming in Bandcamp’s apps, and for download in multiple formats (MP3, FLAC, ALAC, WAV, AIFF). Format choice is standard across the platform; many artist pages enumerate the options explicitly. You can also buy physical media (typically CD, vinyl, sometimes cassette), in which case the digital album is also included for download and streaming. Finally, you can also buy merch (t-shirts, stickers, mugs, etc.).

There is **no all-you-can-stream subscription for the global catalog**. Bandcamp does support *artist-run* subscriptions (opt-in, per-artist) that bundle exclusives and ongoing support.

## How the sampling limit works

Bandcamp allows **full-track sampling a limited number of times** before nudging you to purchase—**three plays by default**. Importantly, the **artist can change this limit** (including allowing unlimited plays), so behavior varies across pages. Bandcamp documents the default and the artist-set nature of the cap in its playlist/about materials and feature posts.

Practically: you can explore an album end-to-end a few times, decide, and then either buy or move on. It’s discovery with a governor, not a meter.

## What you get when you buy

1. **Ownership + formats.** Purchases unlock **permanent downloads** in common lossless and lossy formats; the app streams what you own. (Artist pages routinely list AIFF/WAV/FLAC/ALAC/MP3 as options.)
2. **Unlimited app streaming of your collection** (web, iOS, Android), plus **offline playback** via on-device downloads in the app.
3. **Community & discovery.** Following artists/labels, seeing other fans’ shelves, and release notifications are built in—but tied to ownership, not passive listening.

## Money flow and fees (the legible part)

Bandcamp’s business model is a **revenue share on the seller side**: **15% on digital** (dropping to **10%** after an artist hits USD 5 000 lifetime digital sales) and **10% on physical** (vinyl, merch). **Payment processor fees** (roughly 4–7% typical) are separate and also deducted from the seller’s payout. Fans generally do **not** see a Bandcamp “service fee” line at checkout; taxes/shipping apply when relevant. These figures are stated in Bandcamp’s policy pages and pricing docs.

On periodic **Bandcamp Fridays**, the company **waives its revenue share entirely for 24 hours**, sending the full purchase amount (minus processor fees) to artists/labels. Bandcamp’s feature posts track impact and current dates.

## Why this model works (and where it doesn’t)

**Incentive alignment.** The sampling cap forces a decision: if you value the record, you pay once and own it. That funnels meaningful money to artists without subscription breakage or catalog churn. The platform’s playlist feature even encodes this norm—playlists are built from tracks you actually own; there’s no free-for-all streaming.

**Resilience.** Owned files (especially lossless) are durable: licensing changes don’t yank them from your library. The app’s offline mode covers travel and patchy connectivity.

**Artist sustainability.** A low, predictable platform share (10–15%) is easier to reason about than fractional-penny stream rates; *Bandcamp Friday* spikes are a transparent accelerator, not a black box.

**Limits.** Discovery can feel slower than algorithmic feeds; sampling caps can be frustrating if you’re grazing widely; and because subscriptions are per-artist, there’s no single payment that unlocks “everything.” These are trade-offs by design.

## What to do with this

* **Use the cap as a filter.** Give a release two or three full listens, then decide; if you’re still on the fence, follow the artist and revisit on a Bandcamp Friday.
* **Buy in lossless when it matters.** If master quality or archival longevity is relevant to you, prefer FLAC/ALAC/WAV; you can always transcode down for mobile. (Artists commonly advertise these formats on their pages.)
* **Lean on the collection feed.** Follow artists/labels and browse other fans’ shelves; Bandcamp’s social layer is small but high-signal.
* **Know the fee geometry.** Your checkout rarely includes a Bandcamp fee; most of your money reaches the artist, particularly on Fridays when the platform waives its cut.

## Bottom line

Bandcamp restores a simple bargain: **sample deliberately, buy what you love, own it in real formats, and stream what you own forever.** The economics are legible, the incentives are sane, and the culture skews toward people who actually care about records. If you want artists to keep making the good stuff, this is one of the cleanest ways to vote with your ears and your wallet.
