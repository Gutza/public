# When Will Russia Fall? (October Update)

Russia is losing the war on Ukraine—not in a single spectacular moment, but through the slow math of attrition. October tightened the screws: more refineries burned, more crude rerouted at discounts, a bigger deficit plugged with costlier debt, and a labor pool stretched to snapping. None of this means Russia can’t fire a hundred missiles tonight. It can. The point is that every month, *Russia's strikes buy less effect for more money, more risk, and more second-order damage to its own economy*.

This monthly note is part of an experiment I started in June and formalized in September: track the *sustainment* question with systematic, quantifiable data. I’ve been posting informal monthly summaries on Facebook and keeping a daily log to cut through the 24-hour news cycle’s amnesia. The core hypothesis is simple: Russia’s war effort will fail where empires usually fail—on logistics, finance, energy and manpower. October’s data moves us further down that curve (plus the curve itself seems to have shifted towards a slightly more aggressive timeline).

## The frame (what we’re testing)

I’m watching four families of signals:

1. whether Ukraine can keep **dislocating Russia’s rear** (refineries, depots, rail, C2);
2. whether **Moscow’s cash burn** is outpacing its refill (oil/gas receipts, debt service, NWF drawdowns);
3. whether **workarounds are getting pricier** (shadow fleet, discounts, import substitution; Belarus/North Korea backfills);
4. whether **domestic slack is gone** (labor shortages, rationing, visible friction).

Caveat upfront: fog-of-war is real, numbers move, and single-source claims get treated with salt. What matters is the direction and the *cost of maintaining it*.

## What moved in October

1. **Ukraine's rear-area strikes went deeper, kept landing.** Ukraine’s drone/missile campaign disabled or degraded at least ~17% of Russia’s refining capacity across September–October, forcing fuel export bans and rationing in places like Crimea. The **Kirishi refinery** (≈6.6% of national capacity) halted its largest unit after an Oct 4 strike; repairs were estimated at about a month ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-kirishi-refinery-halts-largest-unit-after-drone-attack-sources-say-2025-10-06/#:~:text=Oct%206%20%28Reuters%29%20,industry%20sources%20said%20on%20Monday); [context on 17% offline](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/ukrainian-strikes-russian-oil-facilities-could-be-boon-us-refiners-2025-09-09/#:~:text=Ukrainian%20attacks%20have%20shut%20down)). A mass drone wave hit **14 regions** in early October, including an ammunition plant in the Volga region—one of the largest single Ukrainian air operations to date ([ABC](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/ukraine-claims-drone-strikes-russian-ammo-plant-oil-126247731#:~:text=Russian%20authorities%20acknowledged%20a%20major)).

2. **Although Russia can still strike, it’s running hotter to do it.** We saw nights with hundreds of Shaheds plus dozens of cruise missiles. That demonstrates capacity, but it also implies tight production cycles and little reserve. Russia’s big salvos increasingly look like throughput, not stockpile—expensive to repeat, and harder to scale when air defenses keep improving.

3. **Cash flow deteriorated.** Oil & gas revenues fell about **23% y/y in September**, pushing the **2025 deficit to ~2.6% of GDP**, 53% above plan ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/russian-finance-ministry-proposes-raising-vat-help-finance-war-ukraine-2025-09-24/#:~:text=In%202025%2C%20the%20deficit%20is,the%20previous%20target%20by%2053); [more](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-announces-budget-changes-aimed-reducing-oil-revenue-dependency-2025-09-18/#:~:text=Russia%27s%20state%20oil%20and%20gas,rouble%2C%20according%20to%20Reuters%27%20calculations)). The Kremlin’s “wartime budget” answer: **raise taxes** (VAT to 22% in 2026), **borrow more at high rates**, and **nibble the sovereign fund**—all of which solve cash today by shrinking growth tomorrow ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/russian-finance-ministry-proposes-raising-vat-help-finance-war-ukraine-2025-09-24/#:~:text=of%20value,of%20the%20war%20in%20Ukraine); [rates/bonds](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/russia-will-borrow-more-than-planned-2025-finance-minister-says-2025-09-09/#:~:text=However%2C%20with%20the%20central%20bank%27s,despite%20the%20low%20debt%20burden)).

4. **Workarounds got costlier.** With refineries offline, Russia **pushed crude exports via western ports up ~25% in September**—selling more barrels, but lower-margin barrels, and relying on pricier “shadow fleet” logistics ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russias-western-port-oil-exports-up-25-after-drone-attacks-2025-10-01/#:~:text=MOSCOW%2C%20Oct%201%20%28Reuters%29%20,attacks%20freed%20up%20more%20crude)). Meanwhile, **EU’s 19th sanctions package** advanced (targeting shadow tankers, finance and high-tech imports), tightening the net around those workarounds ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-zelenskiy-welcomes-presentation-19th-sanctions-package-russia-2025-09-19/#:~:text=,on%20the%20Telegram%20messaging%20app)).

5. **Manpower is a slow-motion constraint.** No new mass mobilization—politically expensive—but attrition remains brutal (Western tallies near **250,000 Russian KIA**, total casualties approaching or exceeding a million). The civilian economy shows it: record-low unemployment (~2.3%) because there **aren’t enough workers**, not because growth is great ([Russia Matters recap](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-sept-24-2025#:~:text=3,Ukraine%20war%2C%20according%20to%20Meduza); [labor shortage reporting](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/russias-labour-shortage-spreads-defence-sector-poaches-staff-2024-11-28/#:~:text=Heavy%20recruitment%20by%20the%20armed,statistics%20service%20showed%20on%20Wednesday)).

## Evidence (October brief)

1. **Kirishi refinery** attack: CDU-6 shut, ~40% of plant capacity offline; repairs ≈1 month ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-kirishi-refinery-halts-largest-unit-after-drone-attack-sources-say-2025-10-06/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20sources%2C%20CDU,the%20plant%27s%20total%20processing%20capacity)).
2. **Refining capacity disabled** (≥~17%) across multiple plants; **fuel export bans** persist/rationing observed ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/ukrainian-strikes-russian-oil-facilities-could-be-boon-us-refiners-2025-09-09/#:~:text=Ukrainian%20attacks%20have%20shut%20down)).
3. **Mass drone raids** across 14 regions, ammo plant targeted; Russia claims 251 drones shot down in one night ([ABC](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/ukraine-claims-drone-strikes-russian-ammo-plant-oil-126247731#:~:text=Russian%20authorities%20acknowledged%20a%20major)).
4. **Crude exports +25% m/m** from western ports after refinery outages ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russias-western-port-oil-exports-up-25-after-drone-attacks-2025-10-01/#:~:text=Daily%20loadings%20of%20Urals%2C%20KEBCO,from%20August%2C%20Reuters%20estimates%20showed)).
5. **Oil & gas revenues −~23% y/y (Sep)**; **2025 deficit ≈2.6% of GDP**; VAT hike flagged ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/russian-finance-ministry-proposes-raising-vat-help-finance-war-ukraine-2025-09-24/#:~:text=In%202025%2C%20the%20deficit%20is,the%20previous%20target%20by%2053)).
6. **Rates high** (key rate peaking around 18% this cycle); **debt service ≈8% of budget** and rising ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/russia-will-borrow-more-than-planned-2025-finance-minister-says-2025-09-09/#:~:text=However%2C%20with%20the%20central%20bank%27s,despite%20the%20low%20debt%20burden)).
7. **EU 19th package**: shadow fleet and energy-finance targeting progresses ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-zelenskiy-welcomes-presentation-19th-sanctions-package-russia-2025-09-19/#:~:text=,on%20the%20Telegram%20messaging%20app)).
8. **External ammo lifeline**: North Korea estimated to supply ~35–50% of Russian artillery shells (long-running assessment; cited by Ukrainian intel, reported by Reuters in Feb) ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-military-spy-chief-says-n-korea-provides-50-russias-ammunition-2025-02-23/#:~:text=KYIV%2C%20Feb%2023%20%28Reuters%29%20,Kyrylo%20Budanov%20said%20on%20Sunday)).

## Analysis: what the facts imply

Russia’s war economy behaves like an engine running above redline: it still moves the car, but each kilometer costs more fuel, more parts, and more roadside repairs. October added friction on all three:

* **Energy**: Strikes force a bad trade—export more crude (lower margin) or keep fuel at home (fewer dollars). Either way, **net funding per barrel falls** while **domestic logistics get brittle**. Transneft has already warned producers about potential output cuts if this continues; that’s not strength; it’s managed decline.

* **Finance**: High rates stabilize the ruble and headline inflation, but they also make **war debt expensive** and **crowd out** the civilian economy. Pushing VAT to 22% in 2026 is not strategy, it's last resort fiscal triage and ultimately an admission of failure; plus, you can tax the present to buy time, but you cannot tax your way to shells, chips, and trained men.

* **Manpower.** Moscow is avoiding a new mobilization decree, but it’s squeezing harder elsewhere: *[the largest autumn conscription since 2016](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/09/29/putin-orders-highest-fall-conscription-target-in-9-years-a90658)* (135,000; with digital-only summons in key regions) and ever-richer bounties for contract “volunteers.” That keeps bodies flowing without the political cost of a fresh mobilization—while poaching labor from buses and factories and raising the long-run bill.

* **Import dependence**: The longer Moscow leans on **North Korean shells** and **Iranian drones**, the more visible and sanctionable those channels become—and the **worse the quality variance**. Adaptation is real; so are diminishing returns.

## The strongest counter-argument (and why it’s failing)

> *“If Russia is ‘failing,’ why did it launch some of its biggest salvos and claim ~5,000 km² this year?”*

Two answers. First, **capacity ≠ sustainability**. A 12-hour barrage is throughput; it says little about whether you can keep that pace after six more refinery fires and another turn of the sanctions screw. Second, **territory ≠ effect** if the exchange rate is catastrophic—hundreds of thousands of casualties for marginal salients, while your budget blows past plan and your rear echelon keeps catching fire ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-zelenskiy-welcomes-presentation-19th-sanctions-package-russia-2025-09-19/#:~:text=), [Russia Matters](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-sept-24-2025#:~:text=3,Ukraine%20war%2C%20according%20to%20Meduza)). Russia can still inflict damage; what’s changed is the **price of each unit of damage**, and the **compounding drag** on its own economy.

## What to watch next

Here are some of the key indicators to watch:
* **Refining offline share** and **fuel rationing** signals (queues, regional price freezes).
* **Western-port loadings** vs **product export bans**—is Moscow still forced into lower-margin crude? ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russias-western-port-oil-exports-up-25-after-drone-attacks-2025-10-01/#:~:text=For%20now%2C%20higher%20exports%20are,its%20crude%20oil%20production%20plans)).
* **EU 19th-package enforcement** on the **shadow fleet**; watch insurance, ship-to-ship transfers, vessel listings.
* **Debt auctions** and **OFZ yields** drifting toward 15%—that’s our tripwire for “financing pain you can’t hide.”
* **NWF (liquid) prints**—how fast does the cushion shrink as VAT is still a year away?
* **Documented North Korean flows** (ammo cadence) and any **Belarus fuel backfill**—lifelines under pressure are still lifelines.

## Bottom line

October didn’t bring a cinematic turning point; it brought something more consequential: **compounding fragility** across Russia’s fuel system, budget, logistics and labor. The consensus window I flagged last month still holds—**late-2025 to mid-2026** for a sustainment break absent a major lifeline—but the probability mass keeps inching earlier as energy attrition and fiscal stress stack ([ICDS overview](https://icds.ee/en/resource-scarcity-and-war-are-strangling-russias-economy/#:~:text=%2A%20Phase%20I%20%282022,distortion%20and%20shrinking%20civilian%20economy)). Russia can still fire. The question is **how much it must pay—in money, fuel, people, and future—to keep firing next month**. In October, that bill went up.
