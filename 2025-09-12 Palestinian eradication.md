# Are there well-founded reasons to believe that Israel is attempting to eradicate the Palestinian population in Gaza?

*(A legal-evidence brief, with sources)*

## Thesis

Yes. There are **credible, documented grounds**—from the UN Commission of Inquiry, the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) provisional measures, major human-rights organizations, UN humanitarian bodies, and even Israeli NGOs—that Israel is **committing acts enumerated in the Genocide Convention with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, Palestinians in Gaza**. Israel rejects this characterization; the ICJ’s merits judgment is pending. But the existing public record already meets the bar for *reasonable grounds to believe* genocidal intent and conduct are present. ([OHCHR][1])

---

## 1) What genocide requires (and what it **doesn’t**)

* **Legal definition** (Genocide Convention, Art. II): any of five prohibited acts **committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part,** a protected group (killing; causing serious bodily/mental harm; **deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction**; preventing births; forcible transfer of children). The Convention **does not** require total annihilation or a specific “speed” of killing. ([United Nations][2])
* **Proving intent**: The ICJ allows intent to be **inferred from a pattern of conduct** where genocide is the “**only reasonable inference**” (*Bosnia v. Serbia*). ([International Court of Justice][3])

**Implication:** “Trying to eradicate” can be evidenced by **policies that make survival impossible** (siege, starvation, water denial, healthcare collapse), even if destruction unfolds over months or years—not days. ([United Nations][2])

---

## 2) Evidence category A: **Official statements indicating destructive intent**

* **Total siege policy** announced 9 Oct 2023 (“no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel”). ([Times of Israel][4])
* **April 2025**: Top ministers reiterate **no humanitarian aid** will enter Gaza; Ben-Gvir: “no reason for a gram of food or aid to enter Gaza.” These statements tie *policy* to *withholding life-sustaining resources*. ([Reuters][5])

These statements are the very type the ICJ and UN bodies examine as **direct or circumstantial evidence** of genocidal intent. ([International Court of Justice][6])

---

## 3) Evidence category B: **Pattern of conduct that destroys conditions of life**

* **Starvation & blockade:** UN OCHA documents **closure of crossings since March 2, 2025**, preventing entry of food, fuel, chemicals for water treatment; aid operations widely suspended or slashed. ([OCHA OPT][7])
* **Fuel denial → systems collapse:** UNRWA and OCHA report **no fuel allowed in for months**, crippling hospitals, bakeries, desalination and sewage plants; WHO warns fuel/aid scarcity is lethal. ([UNRWA][8])
* **Famine and mass malnutrition:** IPC classifies Gaza in **Emergency (IPC 4) with confirmed famine and high risk of spread**; WHO: people are **“starving, sick and dying”** as aid is withheld. ([IPC Info][9])
* **Deliberate water deprivation & WASH destruction:** HRW’s **179-page report** concludes **extermination** and **acts of genocide** via **intentional denial of water** and **destruction of water/sanitation infrastructure**. ([Human Rights Watch][10])
* **Concentration & depopulation plans:** HRW (May 2025) warns of a plan to **flatten infrastructure** and **force the entire population into a tiny “humanitarian area,”** describing an escalation toward **extermination**. ([Human Rights Watch][11])

These are classic examples of **Article II(c)**: *deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about destruction*. ([United Nations][2])

## 4) Formal findings to date

* **UN Commission of Inquiry (2025)**: Finds Israel **committed genocide in Gaza** (four of five genocidal acts) and cites **explicit statements + conduct** as evidence of intent; names senior officials for **incitement**. Israel rejects the report. ([OHCHR][1])
* **ICJ (Jan, Mar, May 2024)**: Orders **provisional measures** based on a **plausible risk of genocide** and directs Israel to **ensure food, water, fuel, medical aid**—orders multiple UN bodies say were disregarded. **Merits judgment pending**. ([International Court of Justice][12])
* **Israeli NGOs (July 2025)**: **B’Tselem** and **Physicians for Human Rights–Israel** publish reports concluding **Israel is committing genocide**; Amnesty International highlights these as a **milestone**. ([B'Tselem][13])

## 5) Addressing the “If they really intended eradication, they’d do it in two days” claim

This argument mistakes **method** for **intent**:

* Genocide by **conditions of life** (starvation, water denial, medical collapse) is **slower but no less genocidal**. The law anticipates this pathway; it does **not** require instant mass killing. ([United Nations][2])
* **“In whole or in part”** means destroying a **substantial part** (e.g., a population within a territory) suffices; completion is **not required**. ([United Nations][2])
* **Constraints** (hostages, international pressure, operational and diplomatic costs) can slow the *tempo* without negating **intent** or **criminality**. What matters is the **pattern of acts** + **policy statements** showing the destruction of the group as such. ([Human Rights Watch][11])

---

## 6) What remains contested (and what doesn’t)

* **Contested**: Israel’s government denies genocidal intent and frames actions as lawful self-defense against Hamas; it disputes responsibility for the humanitarian collapse and says sufficient aid is entering. Legal merits at the ICJ are unresolved. ([Reuters][14])
* **Not really contested in UN data**: **Extended aid blockades**, **fuel denial**, **famine classifications**, and **collapse of life-supporting systems**. These are documented across **OCHA, WHO, UNRWA, IPC**—independent of any one NGO’s view. ([OCHA OPT][7])

---

## 7) Bottom line

Given (i) **explicit policy declarations** constricting life-sustaining aid, (ii) a **sustained pattern** that engineers **starvation, thirst, disease, and medical system collapse**, and (iii) **authoritative findings** (UN COI; ICJ provisional measures; HRW; Israeli NGOs), there are **strong, fact-based reasons** to believe Israel is **attempting to destroy, at least in part, the Palestinian population in Gaza**—that is, **attempting eradication in the sense contemplated by the Genocide Convention**. Dismissing this as a “conspiracy theory” ignores the public record amassed by mainstream institutions. ([OHCHR][1])

### A note on language

This brief uses “*eradication*” to reflect **Article II’s** “*intent to destroy, in whole or in part*.” In law, **intent + acts** suffice; **speed or total success** does not. That’s why famine engineering, water deprivation, and healthcare destruction—if intentional and group-directed—are **genocidal**, even when the killing is **indirect and protracted**. ([United Nations][2])
