description: Russia is in managed decline—paying more for shrinking gains, rebasing its fleet, straining finances, and inflating NATO risk—and urges planning now for post-war realities.

# Wake up! Russia is falling

*Start planning for post-war realities*

Russia is not on a winning trajectory. It is burning people, money, ships, and time—while resorting to cheap risk inflation against NATO to slow Western aid. You don’t have to take it on faith; the data are piling up.

## The barrage of bad news (stacked, recent, verifiable)

* **Brazen but brittle coercion at NATO’s edge.** On **19 Sept 2025**, three Russian MiG-31s penetrated Estonian airspace for \~12 minutes; Tallinn invoked **NATO Article 4**. Moscow denied it, but NATO scrambled F-35s and allies called it reckless—classic risk-by-proxy when you can’t change the battlefield. ([Reuters][1])

* **Pokrovsk meat-grinder, low payoff.** Russia is throwing waves of infantry at Pokrovsk to “unlock” Donbas—and stalling. **ISW’s 19 Sept update**: continuous assaults, **no advance**. Kyiv says it’s inflicting heavy losses and counterpunching around Pokrovsk/Dobropillia. (Fog-of-war caveat, but the direction is consistent.) ([Institute for the Study of War][2])

* **Sick, scraped-barrel manpower.** Multiple outlets report units of HIV/hepatitis-positive soldiers **segregated and sent to the Pokrovsk sector**, sometimes with armbands denoting illness. Treat specifics with caution, but even **pro-Kremlin commentators** have aired the “separate units” claim—evidence of a force accepting extreme health risks to keep numbers up. ([The Telegraph][3])

* **Strategic naval retreat in the Black Sea.** Ukrainian strikes forced Russia to **rebase most combat-ready ships out of Crimea**; even Russian-installed officials conceded relocations. The fleet’s freedom of maneuver has been curtailed since 2024 and remains constrained. ([Reuters][4])

* **Deep strikes inside Russia, with real economic effects.** Ukrainian drones repeatedly hit **refineries and petrochemical hubs** (Bashkortostan, Volgograd, Saratov, Samara). **Novatek’s Ust-Luga** complex suffered an attack in August, forcing **export rerouting via Novorossiisk**. Knock-on effects include **gasoline export bans**, fuel tightness, and ad-hoc logistics fixes. ([Reuters][5])

* **Air defense saturation ≠ victory.** Russia still fires **huge swarms** (805 drones on 7 Sept; \~580 drones + 40 missiles on 20 Sept), but these are **costly holding actions** that don’t create durable gains—and they provoke more Western air-defense support. ([Reuters][6])

* **War finances: narrowing room to maneuver.**

  * **Oil & gas budget revenue down \~20.5%** YTD; September expected **-23% YoY**. Officials weigh **new VAT hikes** despite prior promises. Borrowing is already near the **full-year plan**. ([Reuters][7])
  * **NWF “liquid” cushion only \~\$49 bn (≈1.8% of GDP)**—not a war chest for years of high-burn fighting. ([TradingView][8])
  * **Rates painfully high** (key rate **17%** after a cautious cut), growth slowing, inflation still elevated—classic signs of an overheated, defense-led economy running out of slack. ([Reuters][9])

* **Sanctions vise tightening on lifelines.** The **EU’s 19th package** is moving (including **LNG measures** and a **“shadow fleet”** crackdown); a **bipartisan U.S. bill** targets Russia’s sanctions-evading tanker network; the EU is advancing plans to **use frozen Russian assets** more directly. Each step chokes revenue or raises costs. ([Reuters][10])

* **Arms dependency on pariahs.** Independent analysis estimates **millions of DPRK shells** delivered to Russia; Tehran’s **Shahed supply/know-how** underpins mass-drone attacks—clear signals that Russia’s own stocks/industry **can’t sustain rate of fire alone**. ([RUSI][11])

* **Elite attrition and bunkerization.** The **resignation of technocrat Dmitry Kozak**—one of the last credible internal skeptics—signals a Kremlin doubling down on loyalty over competence. That’s how you make **worse decisions faster**. ([The Washington Post][12])

None of these items alone “ends” the war. Together, they sketch a state grinding forward **only by paying higher and higher prices** for smaller and smaller gains.

## Why the provocations then?

Because they’re **cheap leverage**. When battlefield momentum won’t deliver, Moscow inflates risk to **nudge Western self-deterrence**: airspace incidents (Estonia), drones straying over Poland/Romania, nuclear name-checking in exercises. It’s not a plan to fight NATO; it’s a plan to **spook NATO**. ([Reuters][1])

## “Sooner than you think” doesn’t mean “tomorrow”—it means “prepare now”

The **sustainment trend** is negative for Russia: expensive manpower (including convicts), constrained energy revenues, high borrowing, imported munitions, and a navy pushed from its main base. Meanwhile, Ukraine proves it can **strike deep**, **ship grain under fire**, and **hold the line** at places like Pokrovsk even under massive pressure. (Again: no confirmed Russian advance there on Sept 19.) ([Reuters][13])

**The Atlantic’s** blunt framing is apt: Russia is losing **not just to Ukraine**, but to **its own strategic self-harm**. That’s what national exhaustion looks like. ([The Atlantic][14])

## What matters next (and what you can do about it)

**1) Plan for a post-war Ukraine that needs speed, not pity.**
Ukraine’s reconstruction bill is **staggering** (World Bank est. \~\$524 bn). What helps is **front-loaded, shovel-ready financing** for ports, power, housing, and local industry—with procurement rules that reward speed and transparency. If you work in energy, construction, logistics, finance, agri-tech, or digital services, start mapping partnerships **now**. ([Reuters][15])

**2) Lock in Europe’s security dividend.**
The right answer to drone/missile terror is **air- and missile-defense depth** across NATO’s east, hardened energy grids, and standardized munitions pipelines. The EU/US moves on **shadow fleet** and **LNG** show how to convert sanctions into **durable force multipliers**; keep pushing enforcement. ([Reuters][16])

**3) Starve Russia’s war economy of oxygen.**
Priorities: enforce oil-price caps by **naming/shaming/delisting** dark fleet hulls; insurance and port-service denial for violators; tighten **dual-use tech** export controls; expand **secondary sanctions** on facilitators. Use the profits from frozen assets and, where lawful, the assets themselves to **underwrite Ukraine’s rebuild**. ([Reuters][17])

**4) Think beyond borders.**
Support Russia-language independent media and civil society in exile; fund demining and war-crimes documentation; prepare for **transitional justice** and a **regional reintegration** that ties Ukraine’s growth to EU single-market access and NATO security guarantees.

**5) Don’t wait for a date.**
No one can timestamp the final straw. But “falling” is a process, and it’s underway. The smart posture is to **assume a hard landing is possible**—then be ready to move personnel, capital, and kit **the day the window opens**.

## Bottom line

Russia is bleeding for inches at Pokrovsk, evacuating ships from Crimea, juggling fuel shortages at home, taxing and borrowing into a slowing, high-rate economy—all while poking NATO to keep us second-guessing ourselves. That’s not strength; it’s **managed decline with propaganda**. The winning move for the rest of us is to **plan, invest, and build**—a safer Ukraine, a sturdier Europe, a NATO that treats the Black Sea like the Baltics: defended, connected, and open for business.
